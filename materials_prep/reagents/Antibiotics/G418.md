G418 antibiotic instruction

The current stock of G418 comes from GENETICIN® (G-418 Sulfate).

Stock in a final concentration of 50mg/mL in -20C

How to make +G418 YPD plates?

Use glass beads to spread 150uL-300uL* of 50mg/mL stock on the YPD plates, 4-5 hrs before you want to use them to plate strains.

*The volume of stock to use depends on the time after making the G418 stock. Generally speaking, after 6 months, greater than 300uL is suggested based on past experience.

Let the plate dry under a cool (<20C is suggested), dark environment. Past experiences indicated that putting +G418 plates in 37C incubator (though dark inside) to dry gave ineffective selection results. Also putting under general light condition and room temperature for over 8hrs before plating strains had shown ineffective selection.
