Quick Competent E. coli
Purpose/Description: This protocol is to prepare any cell strain for electroporation. It is specifically for strains that are not frequently transformed and for which we do not have freezer stocks, including strains with one plasmid that you'd like to add a second plasmid to or new strains that you haven't tested out yet. Primarily the cells need to be cold (below 4 C) and washed of as many conductive ions as possible to maximize transformation efficiency.
Short Protocol:

Day 1

1. Add the following to a 14 mL culture tube:

Reagent
	

Amount
	

Where to Find it

Growth media

(generally LB)
	

3-5 mL + 3mL x number of desired aliquots
	

Room temp stocks

Antibiotics
	

To proper concentration
	

-20 C Freezer

Cell stock / culture / colony
	

Colony stab / few uL from overnight culture
	

-80 C Freezer, culture tube, Petri plate

2. Inoculate cell culture or colony in 3-5 mL growth media (generally LB) and incubate overnight in 37 C shaker.

3. Place 10-20 mL molecular grade water (in 50 mL conical tube) in -20 C or -80 C freezer.

Day 2

4. Dilute overnight culture 1:50 into 3 mL fresh broth (60 uL overnight culture) for each aliquot you need. For example, if you need to transform 5 constructs set up 15 mL of culture and inoculate with 300 uL of overnight broth.

Note: some strains settle to the bottom of the culture tube while incubating overnight. Briefly vortex or pipette to mix culture before extracting culture.

5. Incubate at 37 C for 1-3 hours. Check OD600 on Nanodrop after 1 hour. The target OD600 is 0.4-0.6.

Note: Multiply the absorbance value at 600 nm measured by the Nanodrop by a factor of 10 to get OD600.

6. Place water from freezer in ice bath, and add 5-10 mL room temperature molecular grade water and shake to cool.

7. Pellet cell culture in 1.5 mL tubes (1 mL culture per tube) by running in refrigerated centrifuge (4 C) for 1 minute at 6000 xg.

8. Remove supernatant. Add 1 mL ice cold water and resuspend cells.

9. Repeat steps 7 and 8.

10. Resuspend cells in 40 uL ice cold water.

11. Follow electroporation protocol.
