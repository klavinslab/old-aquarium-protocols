##Protocol:##

Day 1:

1. Get Bottle and Stir Bar: Retrieve one Glass Liter Bottle from the glassware rack and one Medium Magnetic Stir Bar from the dishwashing station, bring to weigh station. Put the stir bar in the bottle
2. Get Powders: Retrieve the container of LB agar powder from the indicated location.
3. Weigh Agar: Using the gram scale, large weigh boat, and chemical spatula, weigh out 29.6 grams of LB Agar powder and pour into the bottle.
4. Using the graduated cylinder measure out 800 mL of DI water.
5. Measure out Water: fill bottle with DI water, shake to get all powder solvated.
6. Autoclave: stick autoclave tape on top of bottle cap, loosen top and autoclave at 110C for 15 minutes
7. Remove from Autoclave: put on thermal gloves and take bottle out of autoclave, place on stir plate
8. Stir: Heat to 65C while stirring at 700 rpm

	Antibiotics

####Common Issues####

	Stuff caked at the bottom: after autoclaving, there is stuff caked at the bottom, do not use this batch, shake harder in step 5, make sure that everything is solvated before autoclaving
