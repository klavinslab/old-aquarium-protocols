##Protocol##

1. Put temporary labels on the tops of four bottles (if put on the side, they will fall off in the heat bath)
1. Weight out the amino acids in the weigh boats and add them to their respective bottles
2. Add 500 mL dIH2O to each bottle, close cap tightly and shake to mix
3. Put all bottles in the heat bath (set to 65 degrees C), and cover
4. Every 10 minutes, remove each bottle and swirl it to check for dissolution
3. Label the four remaining bottles (amino acid, date, id number) and attach the four bottle top filters using the white plastic hose adapter: Make sure the inside of the filter cap and bottle remain sterile! 
4. When fully dissolved, filter sterilize the amino acid solutions into the sterile bottles
5. Remove and discard the filter, and replace the cap

####Additional Information and Settings####

    Make a subset of the amino acid solutions, rather than all 4
        His
        Leu
        Trp
        Ura

####Common Issues####

    Amino acids not dissolving:
        - Make sure correct amount was added
        - Make sure heat bath is at correct temperature
