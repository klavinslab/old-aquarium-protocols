##Protocol##

Day 1

1. Setup water bath at 50 C (in room B040).
2. Label 50 mL conical tube M9CA + [appropriate anitbiotic].
3. Place a foam rack (often found in shaker) into the water bath with the 50 mL tubes inserted into it.
4. Label petri dishes with 'M9CA + [antibiotic(s)]'.
5. Add 500 mg of agarose to a 125 mL flask. Add 50 mL of M9CA broth. (This should be enough for 3-4 plates).
7. Microwave on full power for 40 seconds. Then microwave in 5-10 second intervals until the liquid is clear. Watch closely to prevent boiling over.
8. Pour the molten agarose / M9CA into the conical tube.
9. Wait 5-10 minutes for the liquid to cool, then add appropriate antibiotics.
10. Pour 12-15 mL into a plate. Rotate plate around to make sure the bottom of the plate is covered. Allow to cool and set in incubator overnight. Add parafilm around the lid and store in 4 C refrigerator for 2-4 months.
