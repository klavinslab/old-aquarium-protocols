PASC preparation (from http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bm050799c):

Required reagents:

    100 mL ice-cold phosphoric acid (85%)

    5 L ice-cold sterile water

    2 g cellulose (Sigmacell 20 or Avicell PH105)

    1 L bottle

    2 50 mL conical tubes

    4 200 mL centrifuge bottles

    Stirrer plate

    Bucket of ice (from Chemistry building)


    In a 1 liter glass bottle, add 2.0 g Sigmacell 20 cellulose powder.

    Add 6 mL sterile water (not specified as ice-cold) and swirl to mix. Creates a cellulose slurry.

    In a fume hood, decant 100 mL phosphoric acid into the two 50 mL conical tubes and set on ice.

    Slowly add 80 mL ice-cold phosphoric acid with vigorous stirring to get all slurry into solution. Allow cellulose mixture to mix evenly.

    Add 20 mL ice-cold phosphoric acid with stirring and watch for mixture to become transparent.

    Set on ice from one hour to overnight (see figure 1A from paper linked above). Stir occasionally.

    Add approximately 600 mL ice-cold water, 100 mL per addition, with vigorous stirring between additions. Cloudy precipitate should appear.

    Transfer cellulose mixture evenly to the four 200 mL centrifuge bottles (~175 mL each) and keep on ice. Rinse PASC bottle with 50 mL ice-cold water two times, distributing contents to centrifuge bottles for a final volume of 200 mL.

    Centrifuge precipitated cellulose at 5000 rpm at 4 C for 20 minutes. Use a deceleration rate of 6. Resuspend in ice-cold water and repeat the process one time to remove phosphoric acid supernatant (2 spins total). After each spin, neutralize the phosphoric acid using sodium hydroxide.

    Combine bottle contents: Resuspend pellet from two bottles by filling ice-cold water to 100 mL and transfer contents from each to a bottle with a pellet. In order to retain as much cellulose as possible, add an additional 50 mL ice-cold water to the now-empty bottle, shake, and decant into the bottle with cellulose. Add ice-cold water to 200 mL.

    Add 2.5 mL 2 M sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) to each bottle to neutralize residual phosphoric acid.

    Centrifuge for 20 minutes at 5000 rpm. Wash and respin two times, or until the pH of the rinse water reaches 5-7.

    Store final PASC cellulose product temporarily as a pellet at 4 C. 


This recipe should make 250 mL of 0.8% M9 PASC media ( 0.8 g / 100 mL).

Notes:

3 M NaOH requires 120 g NaOH per liter aqueous solution.

The PASC cellulose slurry can be kept long-term at 4 C by adding a small amount of sodium azide (we havenâ€™t tried this).
