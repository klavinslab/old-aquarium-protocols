##Protocol##

###### Day 1

1. In a fume hood, decant 100 mL phosphoric acid into the two 50 mL conical tubes and set in fridge (or on ice).
2. In an empty, sterile 500 mL liter glass bottle, add 2.0 g Sigmacell 20 cellulose powder.
3. Add 6 mL sterile water and gently swirl to mix. Creates a cellulose slurry. Set slurry in fridge (or on ice).
4. Slowly add 80 mL ice-cold phosphoric acid in roughly 25 mL increments with vigorous stirring between steps to mix all cellulose slurry. Allow cellulose mixture to mix evenly.
5. Add 20 mL ice-cold phosphoric acid with stirring and watch for mixture to become transparent.
6. Place solution in fridge overnight. Swirl solution occasionally, if possible.

###### Day 2

1. Add bucket rotor with and chill large centrifuge to 4 C. Preset to 5,000 RPMs and deceleration rate of 6.
2. Add approximately 300 mL ice-cold water, 100 mL per addition, with vigorous stirring between additions. Cloudy precipitate should appear.
3. Transfer approximately 100 mL of the cellulose mixture evenly among the four 200 mL centrifuge bottles.
4. Once per centrifuge bottle, add 100 mL ice-cold water to the now-empty 500 mL bottle, shake vigorously, and decant to fill one centrifuge bottle to 200 mL.
5. Centrifuge precipitated cellulose at 5000 rpm at 4 C for 20 minutes. Use a deceleration rate of 6. 
6. Resuspend in ice-cold water and repeat the process one time to remove phosphoric acid supernatant (2 spins total). After each spin, neutralize the phosphoric acid supernatant in the fume hood using 3 M sodium hydroxide solution.
6. Combine bottle contents: Resuspend pellet from two bottles by filling ice-cold water to 50 mL and transfer contents from each to a bottle with a pellet. In order to retain as much cellulose as possible, rinse the now-empty bottle with an additional 50 mL ice-cold water, shake, and decant into the bottle with cellulose. Repeat rinse and decant. Add ice-cold water to 200 mL.
5. Neutralize residual phosphoric acid: add 2 mL 2 M sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) to each bottle, shake, and sample 0.5 uL of the solution on pH indicator paper. Continue adding in 500 uL increments, with shaking and sampling, until pH goes above 7 (starts to turn green).
6. Centrifuge for 20 minutes at 5000 rpm. Wash and respin two times, or until the pH of the rinse water reaches 5-7.
7. Store final PASC cellulose product temporarily as a pellet at 4 C. 

**Use the PASC to make 250 mL of M9 0.8% PASC or 500 mL of M9 0.4% PASC solution.**

When making M9 PASC media, please do the following:
* To account for any imbalances between the two bottles, use all of the recovered PASC material - from both bottles - for one media preparation.
* To maximize PASC transfer to the media bottle, please use the centrifuge bottles as an intermediate bottle for at least three rinses for all large volume transfers of the M9 media, including 25 mL serological pipette transfers of 5x M9 salts and sterile DI H2O.

Day 2

1. After 24 hours of storage, retrieve and use in M9 media or continue storage

####Additional Information and Settings####

* 3 M NaOH requires 120 g NaOH per liter aqueous solution.
* The PASC cellulose slurry can be kept long-term at 4 C by adding a small amount of sodium azide (we havenâ€™t tried this).

####Common Issues####

    Cellulose chunks falling off pellet into supernatant:
        - Slower deceleration rate: make sure the centrifuge deceleration rate is set to 6 or lower.
        - Immediate attention: decant supernatant immediately after centrifuge stops spinning. Use a timer if you need it!
    Ran out of NaOH solution!!:
        - Use the pellets: substitute 72 g or 36 g NaOH pellets for the 600 mL or 300 mL 3 M NaOH solution after spins 1 or 2, respectively.
        - Make more 3 M NaOH: 120 g per liter water for 3 M solution.
