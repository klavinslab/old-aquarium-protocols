##Protocol##

Day 1

1. In a 1 liter glass bottle, add 2.0 g Sigmacell 20 cellulose powder.
2. Add 6 mL sterile water (not specified as ice-cold) and swirl to mix. Creates a cellulose slurry.
3. In a fume hood, decant 100 mL phosphoric acid into the two 50 mL conical tubes and set in fridge (or on ice). Also, set cellulose slurry in fridge (or on ice).
4. Slowly add 80 mL ice-cold phosphoric acid with vigorous stirring to get all slurry into solution. Allow cellulose mixture to mix evenly.
5. Add 20 mL ice-cold phosphoric acid with stirring and watch for mixture to become transparent.
6. Set on ice from one hour to overnight (see figure 1A from paper linked above). Stir occasionally.
7. Add approximately 600 mL ice-cold water, 100 mL per addition, with vigorous stirring between additions. Cloudy precipitate should appear.
8. Transfer cellulose mixture evenly to the four 200 mL centrifuge bottles (~175 mL each) and keep on ice. Rinse PASC bottle with 50 mL ice-cold water two times, distributing contents to centrifuge bottles for a final volume of 200 mL.
9. Centrifuge precipitated cellulose at 5000 rpm at 4 C for 20 minutes. Use a deceleration rate of 6. Resuspend in ice-cold water and repeat the process one time to remove phosphoric acid supernatant (2 spins total). After each spin, neutralize the phosphoric acid supernatant in the fume hood using 3 M sodium hydroxide solution.
10. Combine bottle contents: Resuspend pellet from two bottles by filling ice-cold water to 50 mL and transfer contents from each to a bottle with a pellet. In order to retain as much cellulose as possible, rinse the now-empty bottle with an additional 50 mL ice-cold water, shake, and decant into the bottle with cellulose. Repeat rinse and decant. Add ice-cold water to 200 mL.
11. Neutralize residual phosphoric acid: add 2 mL 2 M sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) to each bottle, shake, and sample 0.5 uL of the solution on pH indicator paper. Continue adding in 500 uL increments, with shaking and sampling, until pH goes above 7 (starts to turn green).
12. Centrifuge for 20 minutes at 5000 rpm. Wash and respin two times, or until the pH of the rinse water reaches 5-7.
13. Store final PASC cellulose product temporarily as a pellet at 4 C. 


Day 2

1. After 24 hours of storage, retrieve and use in M9 media or continue storage

####Additional Information and Settings####


	3 M NaOH requires 120 g NaOH per liter aqueous solution.

	The PASC cellulose slurry can be kept long-term at 4 C by adding a small amount of sodium azide (we havenâ€™t tried this).
