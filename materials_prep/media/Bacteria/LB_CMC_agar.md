##Protocol:##

Day 1:

1. Get Bottle and Stir Bar: Retrieve one Glass Liter Bottle from the glassware rack and one Medium Magnetic Stir Bar from the dishwashing station, bring to weigh station. Put the stir bar in the bottle
2. Get Powders: Retrieve the container of LB agar powder and CMC powder from the indicated locations.
3. Weigh Agar: Using the gram scale, large weigh boat, and chemical spatula, weigh out 29.6 grams of LB Agar powder and pour into the bottle.
4. Weigh CMC: This time use the weigh paper, make sure to zero, weigh out 0.8 grams of CMC powder. Pour into bottle.
5. Measure out Water: fill bottle with DI water until it reaches the 800 mL line, shake to get all powder solvated.
6. Autoclave: stick autoclave tape on top of bottle cap, loosen top and autoclave at 110C for 15 minutes
7. Remove from Autoclave: put on thermal gloves and take bottle out of autoclave, place on stir plate
8. Stir: Heat to 65C while stirring at 700 rpm
9. Add Antibiotic: while heating and stirring add 4 mL kan 1.6 mL amp using a P1000 micropipette
