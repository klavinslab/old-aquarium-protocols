Gateway Cloning

General Purpose Short Protocol - BP Reaction
Set-up time: ~10 min
Total Time: 1 - 1.5 hours

1. Before beginning any of these steps, first clean off the pipettes with EtOH to limit contamination of the enzymes.

2. Add the following to a carefully labeled tube, and mix gently before each addition:


Reagent
Amount
Where to Find it
attB-PCR: your gene
x uL (~75 ng)
-20°C Freezer or Refrigerator
pDONR plasmid DNA
y uL (~75ng)
-20°C Freezer - Miniprep diluted to 150 ng/uL
TE Buffer - pH 8.0
4 - y - x uL
Room Temperature stock

3. Gently mix, and spin down mixture.  Do the same for the BP Clonase II enzyme mix.

4. Add 1 uL of BP Clonase II enzyme mix (keep the enzymes cold).  Mix entire solution and spin down briefly.

5. Incubate the reaction at room temperature for 1 hour or more.

(OPTIONAL: DON’T DO) 6. Add .5 uL of Proteinase K to stop the reaction, mix, and incubate at 37°C  for 10 min. (*Optional) 

7. Proceed directly to transformation using 2 uL of the reaction and plate on Kan plates.  Remember to let the E. coli begin expressing resistance proteins for >30 mins in the 37°C shaker incubator before plating.  

8. Miniprep


General Purpose Short Protocol - LR Reaction
Set-up time: ~10 min

Where to Find it
gene-pDONR:
entry clone
x uL (~75 ng)
-20°C Freezer or Refrigerator - Miniprep from BP reaction
Destination Vector
y uL (~75 ng)
-20°C Freezer - Miniprep stock diluted to 150 ng/uL
TE Buffer - pH 8.0

3. Gently mix, and spin down mixture.  Do the same for the LR Clonase II enzyme mix.
4. Add 1 uL of LR Clonase II enzyme mix (keep the enzymes cold).  Mix entire solution and spin down briefly.
5. Incubate the reaction at room temperature for 1 hour or more.
(optional) 6. Add .5 uL of Proteinase K to stop the reaction, mix, and incubate at 37°C  for 10 min. 
7. Proceed directly to transformation using 2 uL of the reaction and plate on Amp plates.

Notes/Tips:
Screening Colonies:
After each reaction (especially the BP cloning), you will likely get colonies that do not contain the correct construct.  To screen these colonies, it is best to select 2-3 to grow overnight, miniprep, and then use a restriction digest to confirm the presence of the insert.  The BP reaction seems to be the most common reaction to give short constructs, so some screening is absolutely necessary before moving on.  If the restriction's lengths are correct, proceed to the LR reaction with that result, and make a glycerol stock of the E. coli containing that gene-pDONR construct.  At this point, you will also want to sequence the miniprep to ensure that no small mutations occured in your gene.

Primer Designs:
For Gateway cloning, we have 2 options for adding the attB sites to the ends of our genes: 1 set of long primers or 2 sets of short primers.  The long primers often fail to amplify our genes from cDNA dues to the instability caused by the long hanging ends of the full attB sites.  Therefore, we usually choose the second option when amplifying from cDNA.  For this we need 2 sets of primers for each gene: 1 that has only a small portion of the attB sites and universal primers that amplify the previous reaction and add the full attB sites.

Destination Vectors:
We have the entire Lindquist Library of yeast destination vectors stored in plates of glycerol stocks in the -80 C freezer in the Klavins Lab.  On these vectors you can choose:
1. Selection Marker - His, Trp, Ura, Leu
2. Copy # - High (2-micron), Low (Centromeric), Single - Integrating
3. Tags - ECFP, EGFP, EYFP, dsRED, Cerulean, TAP, HA: Ctag or Ntag
4. Promoter - GPD (constitutive), or GAL (inducible).
