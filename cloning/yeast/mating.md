Introduction
The protocols below rely on being able to select for diploids using selective media. This means that the two haploid yeast strains being mated together must have complementary selective markers - if they have an identical set of selective markers it won’t work. There is still a way to mate yeast if they have the same markers, but it is labor-intensive and slow (ask Nick or Kyle to explain the method).

Yeast mating is very robust - it only really requires that cells of each mating type are able to bump into each other and a nutrient-rich, warm environment (like YPAD at 30C). All of the protocols can be scaled up/down and the numbers are only general guidelines (deviate where necessary).


Liquid overnight protocol:
	1. Place 100µL of YPAD into as many 1.5mL tubes as there are haploid yeast strains.
2. Transfer ~1/3 to half of a haploid yeast colony from a streak plate to each 1.5mL tube with a toothpick. Spin the toothpick to mix.
3. Prepare culture tubes containing 2mL of YPAD. You need as many tubes as there will be matings (mated diploids).
4. Transfer 5-10 µL of haploid yeast suspension from a 1.5mL tube containing one mating type into a culture tube.
5. Transfer 5-10 µL of the other mating type suspension into the same culture tube.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all of the desired combinations are done.
7. Place in the 30C shaker incubator.
8. The next day, streak out 5-10 µL of each culture onto selective media. Make sure the media is selective for at least one marker from each haploid parent, ensuring that only mated diploids will survive.

Super-fast one-day protocol:
1. Follow steps 1-7 in the liquid overnight protocol, except use culture tubes of 100 µL YPAD instead of 2mL. The small volume makes the culture more dense, increasing the likelihood of haploids meeting each other.
2. Allow cells to culture for 6+ hours. It may be sufficient to wait 4-5 hours, but this has not been tested.
3. Follow step 8 from the liquid overnight protocol.
