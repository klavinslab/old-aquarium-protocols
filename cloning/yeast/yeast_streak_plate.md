Description: Streaking yeast on a plate is just like any other streak technique: 
the goal is to make a manual dilution across the plate surface, resulting in individual isogenic colonies that (ideally) arose from a single cell.

##Protocol##

1. Label the plate(s). Include at least this information:
		Unambiguous strain name
		Which colony is on each region (e.g c1-c8 for 8 colonies)
		Initials
		Date

	     Sector the plates - divide them into quarters/eighths with a marker.
2. Inoculation
This step can be done in advance (when coming from glycerol stock/liquid stock) or one at a time (when coming from a plate).

		From glycerol stock:
Place a half-drop amount of frozen glycerol stock in the corner (near the plate edge) of each sector - the same corner each time. Allow to dry**

		From transformation plate/other plate:
Dab the middle/top of an isolated colony with one side of a toothpick to pick up a barely-visible amount of yeast. Touch this to a YPAD sector near the center of the plate and begin streaking (see step 3 for technique).

** If you are only streaking out a few sectors (1-4), it is not necessary to let the drop dry.
3. Streaking
Technique is relatively simple - move the toothpick back and forth as many times as you can, moving forward. Ideally, do this without going back through a previous streak. Use a shallow angle in order to avoid scratching the agar surface. A toothpick can be used to streak out two regions - once on one edge, then once on the opposite edge of the same tip (rotate the toothpick on its axis).

If streaking from glycerol stock:
Only one streak region is necessary in most cases. Use two streak regions if putting more than four strains on a plate.
If streaking from a plate source:
	Four streak regions are necessary:
	Streak the plate as diagrammed - start from the center and move outwards.
4. Repeat steps 2 & 3 as necessary until completed.
5. Place the plate in the 30C incubator. You will see growth in the dense regions after one day and usable isolated colonies after two days.

####Additional Information and Settings####
Sterile pipet tips are also okay (more expensive + harder to use), as is a sterile inoculating loop

####Common Issues####

None
