Note on yeast aliquots:
    Frozen aliquots are easy - just grab them from the freezer and follow the directions below.
    Fresh aliquots require preparation and planning:
	    1. Start an overnight culture the day before. You will need ~1mL overnight culture for every 6 aliquots you plan to make. (in YPD)
	    2. Dilute the cells in YPD in the morning (cells must be in log phase when harvested). A 1:50 dilution should be harvested 5-6.5 hours later and a 1:100 dilution should be harvested 6.5-8 hours later.
   	 3. Harvest the cells by centrifugation (3000xg for 5 min), wash once with water and once with 100mM LiOAc. Resuspend final pellet in 4 pellet volumes of 100mM LiOAc.


1. Boil aliquots (or just one) of carrier DNA (salmon sperm) by heating to 98°C for 5-15 min in the thermocycler.  Cool to -4°C and keep in the refrigerator/on ice.

2. Heat a water bath/heat block to 42°C.

3. Meanwhile, obtain as many aliquots of yeast cells (50 uL) as you need plus one more, and thaw by holding in your hand for ~30 sec.  Pellet ~20 seconds in tabletop centrifuge.  The extra aliquot is your negative control. Remove the ~50µL supernatant.

4. Add the rest of the reagents in the order listed and resuspend by vortexing strongly (setting 8 or 9) for about 1 minute or until mixed.  The order of reagents added is super important for cell health. Frozen competent cells resuspend more easily.

(optional: incubate 30 minutes at 30C with shaking)

5. Heat shock mixture in a water bath or heat block set to 42 C for 10-15 min. *note: we have not optimized the heat shock duration.  Any time between 10 and 60 minutes may give better results, this should be tested.

6. Spin the tube down for ~20 seconds on a small tabletop centrifuge.  Remove the supernatant carefully with a pipettor (~400 µL setting total).

7. If using lower-efficiency integrating plasmids, add 200 uL of sterile H2O and resuspend by vortexing on a high setting (9 or 10). For higher-efficiency plasmids, add 600uL.  Mix by vortexing.

8. Plate 200 uL of the cells on an appropriate selective plate as well as any useful controls. Important note: if using an antibiotic like G418, let the cells recover for 2-3 hours before plating or plate on nonselective media first, then replica plate the next day.

9. Incubate plates inverted at 30 C for 3 days (e.g. plate on Monday, check on Thursday) or until small (~2mm diameter) colonies appear.


Reagents/Supplies:

Notes/Tips:

Integrating Plasmids:
Getting successful transformants with integrating plasmids can be challenging.  If more transformants are needed, increase the amount of plasmid DNA.  Be sure to linearize (cut) the plasmid within the selectable marker (i.e. His, Trip, Leu, or Ura regions) if you are using a 303, 304, 305, or 306 vector.
