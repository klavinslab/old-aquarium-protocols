Sequencing DNA through Genewiz

Set-up time: ~30 min
Total Time: 1 day
Klavins lab PO number: P697721
Klavins lab quote number: MS0721101

Note: Sequencing reactions must be setup in 8-well or 12-well strip tubes and with the initials of the person who is ordering it. For the SBW12 class this will generally be Rob, so you can label your wells “RE01” for the first sample and “RExx” for the last sample, where xx is the total number of reactions being sent in (see below for example with initials “GW”).


Sequencing submissions, by day: please update this list if you want your sequencing to go out!

Plasmids:

500 ng plasmid
2.5 uL primer @ 10 uM*
H2O to a total volume of 15 uL
* This is from a stock diluted from the 100 uM storage stock, and should always be diluted in H2O. TE buffer can inhibit the sequencing reaction!

Example: Your miniprep has a concentration of 70 ng / uL. Add 7 ul DNA (rounding to the uL that gets you closest to, or just over, 500 ng is fine), 2.5 uL of your sequencing primer (only one - this is not a PCR reaction!), and 5.5 uL molecular grade water.

For most cases, 500 ng of plasmid material is required. If, however, you are sending in a plasmid larger than 6kb refer to this guide for how much to send.

PCR products:

Use the guide to determine how much of your PCR product you must add. The same amount of primer (2.5 uL of 10 uM primer) and water (fill to 15 uL total volume) are required.

Waiting for results
If sent out in the day’s shipment, your results will likely arrive by 2:30 the next day. Starting Feb 20, 2012 the Genewiz Seattle lab will be running and will provide sequences at 9 am the next day. That’s almost 12 hour turnaround time!!

Improving trace quality 

Many sequencing traces can be cleaned up for higher quality reads (primarily N’s that appear after 800-900 bases) by submitting your sequence data to PeakTrace Online. It’s a great tool that is free for up to 10 traces per day per IP address.
