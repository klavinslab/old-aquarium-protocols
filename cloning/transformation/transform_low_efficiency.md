Transformation of diluted competent cell aliquots for low-efficiency constructs

This protocol can be necessary when performing oligo assembly or other high-complexity Gibson assembly reactions. The general idea is to purify the product of the Gibson assembly reaction using a PCR purification column, which removes enzymes and salts, and to transform the purified product in high volume (5 to 10 uL) to diluted cell aliquots.

PCR Purification of Gibson assembly reaction
Follow PCR purification protocol to purify the Gibson assembly reaction. Elute in 30 uL molecular grade H2O.

Dilute competent cell stock
Dilute the 40 uL competent cell aliquot to 160 uL by adding 120 uL ice-cold water, then split the culture into four tubes (40 uL each). It is often easiest to work with 8- or 12-well strip tubes with the aluminum blocks to keep the cells cold and accessible. Add 5-10 uL source DNA from the PCR purification. 

Transformation
Transform each diluted cell aliquot in the electroporator. Resuspend each cell aliquot in 250 uL LB and incubate at an appropriate temperature for the cell strain (often 37 C). Spread all 250 uL on an appropriate selective LB agar plate using sterile glass beads.
