Parameters: plasmid, type of strain, type of rescue medium, voltage of electric shock, duration of recovery in incubator
Steps:
 * Get the electroporator, click on and set voltage to be 1250V.
 * Prepare the LB medium for rescue aside the electroporator.
 * Prepare the 1.5 mL tube, label it as Pt.
 * Prepare a tube rack
 * Grab the plasmid
 * Grab the ice blocks
 * Get the electrocuvette and put alongside the ice block
 * Get an aluminum tube rack and put on the ice block
 * Grab the electro competent cells and put in the aluminum tube rack
 * Return to bench and wait for the competent cells to become slushy and add your plasmid in the competent cell tube, 
   mix with tip.
 * Transfer the content (mixture of cells and plasmid) to electrocuvette
 * Put the cuvette in the electroporator, press the PULSE button twice to deliver a pulse.
 * Remove the electrocuvette from the electroporator and add 1 mL of room-temperature LB to it, 
   pipetting up and down 5-7 times to extract the cells from the 1 mm gap.
 * Transfer entire contents of electrocuvette to the tube labeled Pt.
 * Incubate tube Pt at 37Â°C for 30-45 minutes. (No need for AmpR marker)
