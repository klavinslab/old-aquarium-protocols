##Protocol##

1. Use serological pipette to add broth to culture tube
2. Add antibiotics and inducers (if any) and mix gently
3. Add cells and attach lid looslely for good aeration
4. Place in tube rack in 37 C incubator overnight

####Additional Information and Settings####

    Antibiotic:
        Amp
        Can
        Chlor
        Carb
    Inducer:
        IPTG
        ATC
    Broth Volume: Make sure you have enough after evaporation (miniprep: 1 mL, glycerol stock: 0.9 mL)
    Broth Type: Important for some downstream procedures
    	TB: gives highest OD, so good for miniprep
    
####Common Issues####

    Bacteria are dropping plasmid:
        - Make sure you are adding the correct amount of antibiotic
        - Make sure antibiotic broth is still good (should be stored in refrigerator for 2 months or less)
        - Check broth for contamination
    No bacteria after 12-24 hours:
        - Make sure that only the proper antibiotics have been added
        - Make sure that media has the proper carbon source
