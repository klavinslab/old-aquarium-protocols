##Protocol##

1. Prepare 30uL aliquots of 0.2% SDS from 2% SDS stock and molecular grade water. Prepare enough for the amount you need plus 10% to account for pipetting/lab error. 

Tubes to use: 1.5mL if less than or equal to 20 samples, PCR strip tubes if more than 20 samples.

Label the tubes with a convenient shorthand - they will be discarded soon.

2. Add ~1/3 of a ~5mm colony to each aliquot and mix well by vortexing.

3. Heat to 90C for 5 or 10 minutes. If using 1.5mL tubes heat for 10 minutes on the benchtop heating block. If using PCR tubes set 90C time for 5 minutes in the thermal cycler.

4. Spin down cellular debris to isolate the lysate supernatant. Nick normally uses 1.5mL tubes and spins them down for 2 minutes at 17,000xg. For other centrifuges (those compatible with PCR tubes), the timing has not been optimized, but should probably be longer. Cellular debris may interfere with the PCR.

5. Set up new tubes with 40uL of MGH2O each, for every colony. Label these well, as theyâ€™re being kept.

6. Add 10uL of lysate supernatant separately to the 40uL MGH2O aliquots. Be careful to avoid picking up cellular debris at the bottom of the tubes.

7. 0.5-1uL of these new 1/10X dilutions can be used as template in PCR reactions for isolating anything that should be on the genome and is small enough to amplify (generally less than 8kb). You must use a polymerase which is good at amplifying large sections of DNA, like Phusion. Taq is generally poor at amplifying anything larger than 2-3kb.
