Colony PCR with Green Taq
(See General PCR Protocol and PCR_GoTaq)

Master mix (7ul):
1ul 10uM forward primer
1ul 10uM reverse Primer
5ul 2x Green taq (GoTaq)

Cell water (3ul): 
Pick one colony from the plate and mix with 10ul of sterile ddH2O or PBS to make 10ul of cell solution
If screening for successful clones, the cell solution should be retained
Sterile glycerol can be added to 50% final concentration, and cell solution can be frozen at -80oC for use at a later date

Reaction Mixture:
Master mix (7ul) + Cell solution (3ul) = 10ul total per tube
Use program "Colony" & change the extension time (1 min per kb)
