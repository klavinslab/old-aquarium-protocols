Camera settings for gel and plate images

One group of settings that tend to work well for the gel documentation system are described below. For more information see the Canon Powershot G10 user manual.

Above: screen capture of button layout from G10 user manual.

Setting
Where to adjust
How to adjust
Mode
Small wheel on top of camera, right of center
Manual (M) mode
ISO level
Large wheel on top of camera, right of center 
ISO 100
Macro
Flower icon on control dial
Use outer wheel to change to macro mode (flower)
White balance
Function menu, using control dial
Tungsten or custom, depending on light source
Zoom
Toggle knob on top, far right
Frame sample, avoid spurious light
Aperture (link)
Button upper right from control dial to toggle, then outer wheel of control dial
3.5 or 4.0, at proper zoom, minimizes exposure time
Exposure
Button upper right from control dial to toggle, then outer wheel of control dial
1 to 5 (& up to 15) seconds, depending on sample

To avoid bumping the gelDoc station while taking images, we have a remote shutter controller with a button to autofocus and capture images. Please use it.

Also, keep the camera on after taking your images. The WiFi-enabled memory card will send the images to the plate reader computer in the Dropbox folder entitled “GelImages” and then automatically shut off after a few minutes of no use. Any computer logged into the soslab.general@gmail.com Dropbox account or sharing the GelImages folder can access the images.
