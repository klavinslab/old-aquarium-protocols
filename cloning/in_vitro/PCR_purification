PCR purification protocol

Prep Time: 0 min
Protocol Total Time: 15 min

Note: if you are using this protocol to remove salts and enzymes from some other reaction like a ligation or a Gibson assembly reaction, substitute “PCR reaction” from the protocol below with your DNA sample.

1. Follow the instructions with the Qiagen kit; this is a short summary of the steps we follow:

Transfer column to clean
1.5 mL tube
Elution
Buffer EB or Water
30 - 50 uL
17,000g / 1 min
Let sit on column 1 min for lower
volumes (30 uL or less)

2. Measure the concentration of DNA from the miniprep on the Nanodrop.


Reagents/Supplies:

Qiagen PCR Purification Kit
PCR Product
Centrifuge or Vacuum Manifold




PCR Purification Kit Set-up
1. Add 95-100% ethanol to Buffer PE

Notes/Tips:
Elution Volume:
If high concentrations of DNA are needed, elute in 30 uL, though some DNA may remain trapped in the column.  If you want the highest possible total recovery of DNA, elute into 50 uL.
