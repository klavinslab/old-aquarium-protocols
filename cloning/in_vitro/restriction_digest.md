Restriction Digest

General Purpose Short Protocol:
Set-up time: ~15 min
Total time: 3 - 6 hours

1. Add the following to a 0.5 mL PCR tube and mix gently:


Reagent
Amount
Where to Find it
dI H20
42.5 - x - y - z uL
Room temp stocks - HyClone bottles
Buffer 10X
5 uL
-20 C Freezer - NEB 1, 2, 3, or 4 tube
BSA 100X
0.5 uL
-20 C Freezer *only if needed*
DNA to digest
x uL (~600-800 ng)
MP or PCR DNA -20 Freezer or Fridge
Enzyme 1
y uL
-20 C Freezer *keep cold*
Enzyme 2
z uL
-20 C Freezer *keep cold*

y and z will vary depending on the amount of DNA you are digesting and the enzymes being used. Each enzyme has a unit concentration listed on the tube, e.g. 10,000 units/mL for PmeI, or 10 units/ÂµL. The rule is: use ~1 unit per 1000ng of DNA you want to digest.


2. Gently mix, spin down, and run in Thermocycler with the following program:

Notes
Incubate
37 C
5 hr
Can be shorter if needed, but >2hr
Denature enzymes

3. If there is no thermocycler available, use a standing incubator overnight, and heat deactivate in a heat block the following morning.


Reagents/Supplies:


Molecular Grade Water
Restriction Enzymes
NEB Buffer 1, 2, 3 or 4 10x
Thermocycler or Incubator + Heat Block
MP or PCR DNA
BSA if needed


Notes/Tips:
Reaction Volume:
The reaction volume can be modified by linearly scaling all reagents by 0.5 to get a 25 uL reaction.  This is best to use when intended for verification, or when you only need a small amount of linearized DNA.  

Buffers:
Each enzyme performs better or worse in each of the 4 available buffers.  Use the NEB Calculator to determine which buffer is best for your enzymes, and whether or not to use BSA in the mix.

Dephosphorylation:
If you plan to digest DNA such that only a small fragment of DNA will be removed, you can add 1 uL of SAP to the digest for the last hour (or more) of the 37C incubation.  This will prevent most of the small fragments from re-ligating with their original vector.
