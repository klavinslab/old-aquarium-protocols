Day 1

1. Add the following to a 0.5 mL PCR tube and mix gently:
    Reagent;      Amount;                 Where to Find it
    dI H20;       42.5 - x - y - z uL;    Room temp stocks - HyClone bottles
    Buffer 10X;   5 uL;                   -20 C Freezer - NEB 1, 2, 3, or 4 tube
    BSA 100X;     0.5 uL;                 -20 C Freezer
    DNA to digest;x uL (~600-800 ng);     MP or PCR DNA -20 Freezer or Fridge
    Enzyme 1;     y uL;                   -20 C Freezer *keep cold*
    Enzyme 2;     z uL;                   -20 C Freezer *keep cold*
 
    y and z will vary depending on the amount of DNA you are digesting and the enzymes being used. Each enzyme has a unit concentration listed on the tube, e.g. 10,000 units/mL for PmeI, or 10 units/ÂµL. The rule is: use ~1 unit per 1000ng of DNA you want to digest.

2. Gently mix, spin down, and run in Thermocycler with the following program:
    Step;             Temp;     Time;         Notes 
    Incubate;         37 C;     5 hr;         Can be shorter if needed, but >2hr
    Denature enzymes; 80 C;     20 min;

####Additional Information and Settings####

    Reaction Volume:
        [Option 1]: The reaction volume can be modified by linearly scaling all reagents by 0.5 to get a 25 uL reaction.  This is best to use when intended for verification, or when you only need a small amount of linearized DNA.  
        [Option 2]:
    Buffers:
        [Option 1]: Each enzyme performs better or worse in each of the 4 available buffers.  Use the NEB Calculator to determine which buffer is best for your enzymes, and whether or not to use BSA in the mix.
        [Option 2]:
    Dephosphorylation: 
        [Option 1]: If you plan to digest DNA such that only a small fragment of DNA will be removed, you can add 1 uL of SAP to the digest for the last hour (or more) of the 37C incubation.  This will prevent most of the small fragments from re-ligating with their original vector.


####Common Issues####

    [Issue 1]: No thermocycler is available,
        - [Solution 1]: Use a standing incubator overnight, and heat deactivate in a heat block the following morning
