Gibson assembly reaction

Notes:
Must know concentrations of all input DNA- write down!
Temperature changes may help- write down!

Fragment Preparation
(Best results with fragments greater than 200 bp in length)
1. Design primers
2. PCR amplify
3a. Gel extraction
3b. DpnI digestion
4. Quantification

General Purpose Protocol
Set-up time: <5 min
Total Time: 1 hour

1. Get 15 uL aliquot labeled “Gibson” (in a 0.5 mL tube) from the middle shelf of the -20°C freezer. Spin down contents of the tube centrifuge and place on ice block

2. Add the following (try to equalize concentrations of all parts):
Reagent
Amount
Gibson master mix aliquot
15 uL
DNA backbone
x uL (40 ng / uL)
DNA insert 1
y uL (27 ng / uL)
DNA insert 2 
z uL (12 ng / uL)
...
(add rows as needed)
Molecular grade H2O
5-x-y-z uL*
* Add enough to make 20 uL final volume

2. Quickly spin down tube to make sure all reagents are pooled at the bottom of the tube. Add tube to a heat block set to 50° C.

3. Incubate for 15-60 minutes (60 minutes ideal).

4. Use 1-2 µL from tube for transformation. Store remainder in -20° C freezer for later use or discard.
