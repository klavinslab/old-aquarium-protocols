Qiagen Gel Extraction Protocol


Protocol Time: 0.5 hours

x1.  Cut fragment out of gel. Place in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.

x2.  Weigh gel slice (Note: some tubes are exactly 1 g, others are not. Use an empty tube to tare the scale).

x3.  Add 3x volume of QG buffer (in uL) to the weight of your gel slice (50 mg gel slice would require 150 uL QG buffer).

4.  Place tube in 50 degree heat block for 10 minutes. Vortex every few minutes to speed up the process.
Note: Check if tube contents look orange or purple. If so, the pH is too high and your DNA will not bind to the column. Add 10 uL of 3 M sodium acetate (NaOAc) and mix.

5. Add 1x volume (50 uL to 50 mg of gel slice) isopropanol. Pipette up and down to mix (do not centrifuge at this step).zsx
Note: this step is only necessary if purifying a band less than 500 bp or greater than 4 kb.

6. Add tube contents to labeled pink Qiagen column. Spin at top speed (> 17,900 g) for 1 minute to bind DNA to column. Empty collection tube.

7. Add 750 uL PE buffer to column and wait five minutes. Spin at top speed (> 17,900 g) for 30 seconds to wash column. Empty collection tube.

8. Add 500 uL PE buffer to column and wait five minutes. Spin at top speed (> 17,900 g) for 30 seconds to wash column. Empty collection tube.

9. Spin at top speed (> 17,900 g) for 30 seconds to remove all PE buffer from column. Label 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Transfer pink column to empty Eppendorf tube.

10. Add 30 uL molecular grade water or EB elution buffer to center of column. Be very careful to not pipette on the wall of the tube. Wait two minutes. Elute DNA into Eppendorf tube by spinning at top speed (> 17,900 xg) for one minute.

11. Spec on Nanodrop to check DNA concentration. If the absorbance value at 230 nm is greater than 5, there are residual salts in the elution that are masking the amount of DNA you have. If a more accurate concentration is necessary for any downstream use, dialyze elution for 20-30 minutes at room temperature to remove residual salts. Re-spec on Nanodrop.
