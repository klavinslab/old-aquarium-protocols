Ligation

General Purpose Short Protocol:
Set-up time: ~15 min
Total time: 45 min

1. Add the following to a 0.5 mL PCR tube and mix gently:


Reagent
Amount
Where to Find it
dI H20
8.5 - x  - y uL
Room temp stocks - HyClone bottles
T4 Lig Buffer 10x
1 uL
-20 C Freezer
DNA digest 1
x uL (~10-20 ng)
digested 'vector'
DNA digest 2
y uL (~6:1 insert:vector molar ratio)
digested 'insert'
T4 Ligase
0.5 uL
-20 C Freezer *keep cold*

2. Gently mix, spin down, and run in the thermocycler as follows:


Step
Temp
Time
Incubate
25 C
30 min
Denature enzymes
65 C
15 min
Fin Hold
4 C
Inf

3. If there is no thermocycler available, keep the mixture on the lab bench at room temperature for 30 min, and then heat deactivate in a heat block set to 65 C.
4. If the next step is transformation through electroporation, remove salts from the solution with a drop-dialysis filter to prevent arcing.


Reagents/Supplies:


Molecular Grade Water
T4 DNA Ligase
T4 Ligase Buffer 10x
Thermocycler or Heat Block
Digested DNA fragments




Notes/Tips:
Amount of Digested DNA to Add:
We've found that using 2-3 times as many insert molecules to vector molecules gives a high probability of correct constructs.  Therefore, if your digests are equi-molar, you will want to add 2-3 times the volume of insert as vector (i.e. about y = 3 uL vector and x = 9 uL of insert).
