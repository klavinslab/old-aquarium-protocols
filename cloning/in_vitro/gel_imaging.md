Camera settings for gel and plate images

To avoid bumping the gelDoc station while taking images, we have a remote shutter controller with a button to autofocus and capture images. Please use it.

Also, keep the camera on after taking your images. The WiFi-enabled memory card will send the images to the plate reader computer in the Dropbox folder entitled “GelImages” and then automatically shut off after a few minutes of no use. Any computer logged into the soslab.general@gmail.com Dropbox account or sharing the GelImages folder can access the images.
