Gel prep:

1. Obtain a gel box, gel tray, and gel comb and rinse with DI water.  Push the tray down fully into the center of the gel box, forming a seal.

2. Measure out 0.4g (for 0.8% gel) to 0.5g (for 1.0% gel) of agarose to the flask.  Change the amount of agarose for higher/lower percentage gels.

3. Add 1X TAE to the flask up to the 50mL line.  If you are out of 1X TAE, make 1L of it by combining 20mLs of the 50X stock with 980mLs of DI H₂O.

4. Microwave for 25 seconds with the default settings.  Swirl to mix.  For safety, waterproof, heat-resistant gloves could be used at this point.

5. Microwave for 10 more seconds and swirl.  Repeat this step until the agarose solution is clear with no more sediment.

6. Add 5µL of GelGreen to the gel and swirl to mix thoroughly.  Alternating the swirling directions works well.

7. Pour the agarose + GelGreen into the sealed gel tray (which is in the gel box) and add a comb to the top of the gel.  Use the thinner teeth for analysis and thicker teeth for a gel extraction.

8. Wait until it solidifies (~20-30 minutes).  If the gel has become significantly cloudy, it's probably solidified.

Running the gel:

1. Lift the gel tray out of the gel box (carefully). Fill the gel box with 1X TAE until it fills both of the box wells and evenly covers the raised center block with about 0.5cm of liquid.  Make sure the electrodes are facing away from you.

2. Place the gel tray into the box.  Angle it in to prevent bubbles.  The comb should be on the left side and there should be no bubbles underneath the gel tray.

3. Add more 1X TAE until the gel surface is evenly covered with ~5mm of liquid.

4. Slowly remove the comb.  Load 10µL of each of your samples, including an appropriate DNA ladder.  Unlike the E-Gel method, any DNA added to a self-poured gel needs to be mixed with loading dye before being added.

5. Turn on the power supply and set it to 100V and 60 minutes.  If you want greater resolution, set it to 80V and 80 minutes.  If you want faster results (and smearier bands), do 110V for 45 minutes.

6. Connect the electrodes to the power supply with the combination safety cover + electrode leads apparatus.  Hit the 'running man' icon to start the power supply.

7. Check on the gel 10 minutes later to make sure the samples are running in the right direction and that there are no other problems.

8. Check on the gel every 30-40 minutes in case it has resolved enough for your purposes.

9. When the gel bands have sufficiently resolved, pause the power supply and then turn it off. Remove the gel tray (with the gel) from the gel box and transfer the gel to the large blue light transilluminator for visualization.  It should slide right of of the tray, so be careful that it doesn't slide off during the transfer!  To remove bubbles under the gel, slowly move the gel around on the transilluminator, allowing the bubbles to escape.

10. Visualize with the gel hood and transilluminator.  Capture an image.
 
11. If you don't need to save the gel, usually for a gel purification, it can be discarded in the biohazard bin.  Rinse out the gel box and gel tray in the sink and leave them out to dry.

This gel has two ladders to control for 'horizontal' inconsistencies in 'vertical' running speed.

Notes/Tips:
Ladders:
Standard NEB ladders that we keep in stock in the lab are:

0.5 - 10 kB

You can also make your own lambda HindIII ladder with our lambda DNA and HindIII enzyme stocks.

Buffers:
TBE can be substituted for TAE.  TAE has historically worked better with gel purifications, though this may no longer be the case.  Buffer can be reused after running a gel, but the quality decreases with every reuse (smeared bands, etc).
