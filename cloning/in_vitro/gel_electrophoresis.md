##Protocol##

1. Rinse gel box, gel tray, and gel comb with DI water
2. Push the tray down fully into the center of the gel box, forming a seal
2. Measure out 0.4g (for 0.8% gel) to 0.5g (for 1.0% gel) of agarose and add to empty 250ml flask
3. Measure 50ml TAE in 100ml graduated cylinder and add to 250ml flask
4. Microwave for 1 minute with the default settings. 
5. Using waterproof, heat-resistant gloves, swirl to mix
5. Microwave for 10 seconds and swirl- Repeat this step until the agarose solution has no sediment
6. Add 5ÂµL of GelGreen 250ml flask and swirl to mix
7. Pour the contents of the 250ml flask into the sealed gel tray and add comb(s)
8. Wait for 30 minutes for gel to solidify
9. Carefully lift the gel tray out of the gel box
11. With the electrodes facing away, place the gel tray into the box with the comb on the left side
10. Fill the gel box with 1X TAE until it reaches the marked fill line on the side of the box
12. Carefully remove the comb
13. Add loading dye to all samples
13. Load all samples and the appropriate DNA ladder
13. Turn on the power supply and set it the voltage and time
14. Connect the electrodes to the power supply with the combination safety cover + electrode leads apparatus 
15. Hit the 'running man' icon to start the power supply and chack for bubbles in the gel box to indicate that voltage is being applied
16. Check on the gel every 30-40 minutes in case the bands have sufficiently resolved
17. When sufficiently resolved, pause the power supply and then turn it off. 
18. Remove the gel tray from the gel box and transfer the gel to the large blue light transilluminator for visualization (It should slide right of of the tray, so be careful that it doesn't slide off during the transfer! 
19. To remove bubbles under the gel, slowly move the gel around on the transilluminator, allowing the bubbles to escape
18. Visualize with the gel hood and transilluminator. Capture an image.
19. If you don't need to save the gel, usually for a gel purification, it can be discarded in the biohazard bin. Rinse out the gel box and gel tray in the sink and leave them out to dry.

####Additional Information and Settings####

Ladders: Ladder Range Link 1 kB 0.5 - 10 kB NEB Site 2 log 0.1 - 10 kB NEB Site 100 bp 0.1 - 1.5 kB NEB Site
Buffer: TBE can be substituted for TAE. TAE has historically worked better with gel purifications, though this may no longer be the case. Buffer can be reused after running a gel, but the quality decreases with every reuse (smeared bands, etc).
Combs: Use the thinner teeth for analysis and thicker teeth for a gel extraction.
Power supply settings: power supply and set it to 100V and 60 minutes. If you want greater resolution, set it to 80V and 80 minutes. If you want faster results (and smearier bands), do 110V for 45 minutes.
