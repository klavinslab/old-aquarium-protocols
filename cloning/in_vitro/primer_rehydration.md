##Protocol##

1. Centrifuge the dry tube (with ballance) at max G's for 1minute.
2. Locate the number of moles of dna that the tube contains.  
[note: it should read xxx.x nm and be located near the bottom right corner of the label]
3. Multiple the number of nm in the tube by 10.  This is the number of uL of TE to resuspend.
4. Pipete the number of nm calculated in the previous step into the tube.  recap the tube and vortex.
5. Place in the -20 freezer in the correct location.  Check the database for proper location.
