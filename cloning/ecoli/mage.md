##Protocol##

Day 1

1. Design primers, order primers
2. Set up initial overnight of starter strain by adding 3 mL of LB liquid growth media to a 14 mL glass tube
3. Innoculate culture with desired starter strain, incubate at 30C

Day 2

1. Take overnight out of shaker
2. Set up a 6 mL culture with LB liquid growth media in a 14 mL plastic culture tube
3. Add 100 uL of the overnight LB culture to the fresh media
4. Incubate at 30 C for an hour
5. Turn on circulating water bath and set to 42 C
6. Ensure that proper rotor and brown cups are in the large centrifuge, close large centrifuge and set to 4 C
7. Close small refrigerated centrifuge and set to 4 C
8. Check optical density of culture, if greater than 0.35, remove from 30C and place in circulating water bath for 15 minutes, if less than 0.30 place back into 30C shaker and wait 20 minutes then repeat this step
9. Remove from circulating water bath, turn off circulating water bath
10. Place sample in centrifuge, create a balance using the balancing materials near centrifuge and place opposite of sample
11. Centrifuge sample at 5000 rpm for 4 minutes
12. Immediately after centrifuge stops, remove sample and pour off supernatant into waste container, taking care not to pour off pellet
13. Decant ice cold sterile DI water to fill the tube half way, seal tube, shake to resuspend pellet
14. Decant more ice cold sterile DI water to fill the tube to 14 mL, seal tube
15. Place tube in centrifuge, remake balance to accomadate for new sample weight
16. Centrifuge sample at 5000 rpm for 4 minutes
17. Immediately after centrifuge stops, remove sample and pour off supernatant into waste container, taking care not to pour off pellet
18. Decant ice cold sterile DI water to fill the tube half way, seal tube, shake to resuspend pellet
19. Decant more ice cold sterile DI water to fill the tube to 14 mL, seal tube
20. Place tube in centrifuge
21. Centrifuge sample at 5000 rpm for 4 minutes
22. Immediately after centrifuge stops, remove sample and pour off supernatant into waste container, taking care not to pour off pellet
23. Keep sample on ice from now on, Using the P1000, aspirate 500 ul of ice cold sterile DI water and eject into sample tube, pipet up and down until pellet is completely resuspended
24. Using the P1000, transfer contents of entire tube of material into 1.5 mL centrifuge tube
25. Place centrifuge tube into small refrigerated centrifuge, make sure to balance with avaliable balance material
26. Centrifuge sample at 6500 g for 2 minutes, stop centrifuge after 1 minute has elapsed
27. Quickly remove tube and using the P1000, aspirate supernatant without disturbing pellet, eject waste into waste container
28. Resuspened the pellet in 80 ul of ice cold sterile DI water
29. Label another 1.5 mL centrifuge tube with the name of the designed primer or set of primers
30. Transfer 40 ul of the cell mixture to the new tube, keep on ice
31. Resuspened primer ordered the day before
32. Dilute primer 10:1
33. Add 4 ul of the primer to the tube of cells
34. Turn on electroporator, set to 1800 volts
35. Using the P100, add entire volume of cell tube to electrocurvette
36. Electroporate
37. Rescue in 250 ul of LB growth media, set in 30 C incubator
38. Prepare 125 mL flask, with 20 mL of LB growth media
39. Add entire rescue to flask
40. Overnight culture at 30 C
