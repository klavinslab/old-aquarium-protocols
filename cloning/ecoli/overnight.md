Notes/Tips:
Broth:
The type of broth used varies by the application.  If we are growing up cells to miniprep, we typically use TB to get a higher OD of cells, though LB works well for any other applications.  Broth that is pre-mixed with antibiotics should be stored in the refrigerator for no longer than 2 months.
