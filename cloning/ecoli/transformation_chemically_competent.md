Notes/Directions 

    - All irrelevent sections/headings are to be deleted. 
        ex. For a single day protocol, delete all references to "Day" 
    - All items in square brackets are place holders to be replaced by some other value
        ex. "[Protocol Name]" could be replaced by "Gel Elecrophoresis"
    - The description is a one or two sentance summary of what the protocol accomplishes

##Protocol##

Day 1

1. [Thaw frozen chemically competent E. coli aliquots on ice (e.g. on top of blue cold block). Slushy or liquid consistency is desirable.]
2. [Add DNA to aliquot. Gently invert to mix.]
3. [Allow aliquot to sit on ice for 10-30 minutes.]
4. [Heat shock cells at 42°C for 45 seconds.]
5. [Add 900µL of SOB to rescue cells.]
6. [If plating on ampicillin, 200µL of cells can be plated immediately. If plating on other antibiotics (kanamycin, chloramphenicol), allow cells to recover for 45-60 minutes before plating. If you expect low efficiency, the last ~800µL can be spun down, 600µL removed, and the rest of the cells plated on another plate.]
