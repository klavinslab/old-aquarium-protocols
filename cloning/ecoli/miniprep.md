##Miniprep##


1. Pipette 1ml of overnight culture into a 1.5 ml tube
2. Centrifuge at 15,000g-17,000g for one minute to pellet bacteria
3. Decant supernatant on into the waste bottle
4. Resuspend the pelleted bacteria with 250 ul buffer P1. Return P1 to fridge
5. Add 250 ul buffer P2. mix thoroughly by inverting 4-6 times
    *Do not let the reaction proceed for more than 5 minutes
6. Add 350 ul buffer N3 and invert 4-6 times
7. Centrifuge for ten minutes at 13000 rpm (~17,000 x g)
8. Apply supernatant into a spin column. centrifuge for 1 minute. decant into waste bottle
9. Wash the spin column by adding 750 ul of buffer PE. centrifuge 1 minute. decant into waste bottle
10. Spin for 1 minute to remove residual buffer. decant into waste bottle
11. Place top portion of column into a clean 1.5 ml tube
12. Add 30-50ul of eluting buffer and wait for 1 minute
13. Centrifuge for 1 minute
14. Check concentration of plasmid by using nanodrop

####Additional Information and Settings####


####Common Issues####

    No Plasmid:
        - Make sure that ethanol was added to PE buffer
    Low plasmid concentration:
        - Decrease elution volume: To have a higher concentration, use 30 ul of EB
        - Use a new NE buffer with the correct ethanol concentration
        - Longer elution: Wait 1-10 minutes after adding EB to the centrifuge column
        - Heated elution: Elute for 10 minutes at 50 degrees C (heat block)
