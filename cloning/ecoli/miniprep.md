Plasmid extraction via Qiagen miniprep kit
General Purpose Short Protocol:
Prep Time: 12 hours overnight growth
Protocol Total Time: 40 min

1. Follow the instructions with the Qiagen kit (BLUE column!); this is a short summary of the steps we follow:

Step
Reagent
Volume
Speed / Time
Notes:
Spin Cells (1.5 mL Eppendorf)
Overnight Culture
1.5 mL (TB)
3 mL (LB)
4,000g / 1 min
Pour off supernatant - may need multiple spins from LB culture to get enough cells
Re-suspend Cells
Buffer P1
250 uL
-
P1 in Refrigerator
To mix, pipette up and down or firmly and repeatedly sweep tube against a rough surface like a tube rack
Lyse Cells
Buffer P2
250 uL
-
Invert 6-10 times
Should turn blue
Neutralize Lysis
Buffer N3
350 uL
-
Invert 6-10 times
Should turn clear with white precipitate
Spin mixture
-
850 uL
17,000g / 10 min
-
Spin through Column
Supernatant
~850 uL
17,000g / 1 min
(or vacuum)
Discard Flow-through
Wash
Buffer PE
750 uL
17,000g / 1 min
(or vacuum)
Discard Flow-through
Dry Spin

17,000g / 1 min
Transfer column to clean
1.5 mL tube
Elution
Buffer EB or Water
30 - 50 uL
17,000g / 1 min
Let sit on column 1 min before spinning

2. Measure the concentration of DNA from the miniprep on the Nanodrop.



Reagents/Supplies:

Qiagen Miniprep Kit
Overnight Cell Culture
Centrifuge or Vacuum Manifold




Miniprep Kit Set-up
1. Add RNase A and LyseBlue to Buffer P1 (store in refrigerator)
2. Add 96-100% ethanol to Buffer PE

Purpose/Description:

Notes/Tips or Extended Protocol:
Elution Volume:
If high concentrations of DNA are needed, elute in 30 uL, though some DNA may remain trapped in the column.  If you want the highest possible total recovery of DNA, elute into 50 uL.
