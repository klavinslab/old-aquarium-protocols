Day 1

1. [pipette 1ml of overnight culture into a 1.5 ml tube]
2. [centrifuge at 15,000g-17,000g for one minute to pellet bacteria]
3. [decant supernatant on into the waste bottle]  
4. [resuspend the pelleted bacteria with 250 ul buffer P1. Return P1 to fridge.]
5. [add 250 ul buffer P2. mix thoroughly by inverting 4-6 times.]
    *Do not let the reaction proceed for more than 5 minutes.
6. [add 350 ul buffer N3 and invert 4-6 times.]
7. [centrifuge for ten minutes at 13000 rpm (~17,000 x g) ]
8. [apply supernatant into a spin column. centrifuge for 1 minute. decant into waste bottle.]
9. [wash the spin column by adding 750 ul of buffer PE. centrifuge 1 minute. decant into waste bottle]
10. [spin for 1 minute to remove residual buffer. decant into waste bottle]
11. [place top portion of column into a clean 1.5 ml tube.]
12. [add 30-50ul of eluting buffer and wait for 1 minute.]
13. [centrifuge for 1 minute]
14. [check concentration of plasmid by using nanodrop]

####Additional Information and Settings####

    [Parameter/variable/clarification/option 1]:
    -make sure  that the buffers have all needed elements (e.g. ethanol)
    [Parameter/variable/clarification/option 2]:

####Common Issues####

    [low plasmid count]:
        - [Solution 1]: To have a higher concentration, use 30 ul of EB
        - [Solution 2]: to have a higher concentration, wait 1-2 minutes after adding EB to the centrifuge column
