NOTE TO READER:  This protocol has not yet been tested by our lab.  it works but i haven’t updated it yet.  Once it has been proven to work, this will be updated with a modified protocol that works in our lab.


(B) PCR-ampliﬁcation of dsDNA substrate for recombineering from plasmid DNA  TIMING 3–4 h
(i) Plasmid templates must be linearized before PCR ampliﬁcation. Digest plasmid DNA with a restriction enzyme at sites present in the vector sequence but absent in the sequence to be ampliﬁed.
(ii) Run an aliquot of the DNA on an agarose gel to verify complete digestion CRITICAL STEP Be aware that super-coiled plasmid migrates at ~70% of the size of a full-length linear species.
(iii) If necessary, cut the band containing the linearized DNA from the gel and extract the DNA
(iv) Resuspend the linear DNA in 20–30 ml TE (pH 8.0), check the concentration using a spectrophotometer (read absorbance at 260 nm) and dilute to 0.5–1.0 ng ml1. A puriﬁed fragment containing just the drug cassette can be stored and reused as template.
(v) Amplify the drug cassette with a pair of chimeric primers, using PCR conditions based on information in Table 2 and a Taq DNA Polymerase with proofreading ability.
(vi) Examine the PCR product by agarose gel electrophoresis
(vii) Gel-purify the desired band to eliminate contamination of supercoiled plasmid.
(viii) If linear plasmid DNA was used as template and the product was not gel-puriﬁed, digest the PCR with 3–5 U of the modiﬁcation-dependent restriction enzyme DpnI per mg DNA (at 37 1C for 2 h), which will cut the plasmid DNA but not the unmodiﬁed PCR product. DpnI digestion may not totally eliminate plasmid background, however.
CRITICAL STEP Do not expose the PCR product to direct UV light, which may damage it and result in abnormal recombination frequencies.
(ix) Clean up the PCR product as described in Step 3A(v).
CRITICAL STEP Do not use supercoiled DNA as template for PCR ampliﬁcation. To avoid having to gel-purify the DNA or treat with DpnI, use the TKC strain as a template when possible.
Induction of the lambda recombination genes  TIMING 3 h
6| Add 0.5 ml of the overnight culture to 35 ml of LB medium in a 250-ml bafﬂed Erlenmeyer ﬂask. Supplement with appropriate antibiotic to maintain plasmids, if needed. Use antibiotic concentration indicated in Table 4.
CRITICAL STEP Dilute the overnight culture by at least 70-fold.
7| Place the ﬂask in the 32C H2O bath and grow cells with shaking for about 2 h or until the cells reach an OD600 of 0.4–0.6.
CRITICAL STEP The growth time may vary with different strains. The cells are ready when the OD600 is 0.4–0.6. It is important not to overgrow the cells, as stationary-phase cells are not optimal for recombineering.
8| Transfer half of the culture to a 125-ml Erlenmeyer ﬂask and place the ﬂask to shake in a 42 1C H2O bath; keep  the other ﬂask at 32C. Shake for 15 min at 200–220 r.p.m. The culture at 42C is induced for recombination functions and the 32C culture is the uninduced control.
Preparation of electrocompetent cells and electroporation of the linear targeting substrate DNA  TIMING 2 h
9| Immediately after the 15-min induction, rapidly chill both cultures in an ice-water slurry; swirl the ﬂasks gently. Leave on ice for 5–10 min. Label and chill two 35- to 50-ml centrifuge tubes for each set of induced and uninduced cells.
10| Transfer both the induced and uninduced cultures to the centrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 4,600g (6,700 r.p.m. in a Sorvall SA-600 rotor) for 7 min at 4 1C. Using sterile technique, aspirate or pour off supernatant.
11| Add 1 ml of ice-cold sterile distilled H2O to the cell pellet and gently suspend cells with a large pipette tip (do not vortex). Add another 30 ml of ice-cold distilled H2O to each tube, seal and gently invert to mix, again without vortexing. Centrifuge tubes again as mentioned in Step 10.
12| Promptly decant the 30-ml supernatant very carefully from the soft pellet in each tube and gently suspend each cell pelletin 1 ml of ice-cold distilled H2O.
CRITICAL STEP Remove tubes from the centrifuge promptly at the end of spin. The pellet is very soft and care should be taken not to dislodge it or lose the cells, especially when processing multiple tubes. If necessary, leave a little supernatant in the tube
13| Transfer the suspended cells to pre-chilled microcentrifuge tubes. Centrifuge at 10,000g in refrigerated microcentrifuge for 30 s at 4 1C. Carefully aspirate the supernatant and suspend cells in 1 ml of ice-cold H2O, centrifuge again and aspirate supernatant, being extremely careful with the pellet.
14| Suspend the cell pellet in 200 ul of sterile cold distilled H2O and keep on ice until used.
CRITICAL STEP For highest efﬁciency, use freshly processed cells.
15| To introduce the linear DNA recombineering substrate (from Step 3) into the electrocompetent cells (from Step 14) by electroporation, chill the desired number of labeled 0.1-cm electroporation cuvettes on ice. Turn on the electroporator and set to 1.80 kV, 25 mF capacitance and 200 O resistance.
16| In labeled microcentrifuge tubes on ice, mix 1 ul of DNA  from Step 3 (B100 ng of salt-free PCR fragment or 0.5 pmol (B100 ng) ss-oligo) with 50 ml of electrocompetent induced or uninduced cells from Step 14. When modifying a multicopy plasmid introduced by coelectroporation, also add 1 ml of the multicopy plasmid DNA (B20 ng ml1) at this point. Include the following controls: Induced cells without DNA. If colonies are present on this control plate, either the selection is not working properly or the cells have a high reversion frequency for the property selected. Uninduced cells plus DNA. This is a control to estimate the number of background colonies due to some contaminating factor in the DNA, such as intact plasmid template from a PCR.
CRITICAL STEP Never leave the DNA–cell mixes on ice for more than B10 min
17| Transfer the DNA–cell mixes to chilled electroporation cuvettes as quickly as possible and introduce the DNA into the cells by electroporation (according to settings outlined in Step 15).
CRITICAL STEP Make sure that the time constant is greater than 5 ms for optimal results. Lower time constants generally indicate impurities or salts in the cells or the DNA.
18| Immediately after electroporation, add 1 ml of LB medium to the cuvette. Do this before proceeding to the next electroporation. After the electroporations are completed, transfer the electroporation mixes in LB to sterile culture tubes and incubate with shaking at 32 1C for a minimum of 30 min.
CRITICAL STEP Failure to allow 30 min outgrowth gives poor cell viability.
