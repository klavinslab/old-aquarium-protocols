Transformation of E. coli (electroporation method)

The transformation efficiency of the electroporation method is heavily dependent on keeping electrocompetent cells ice-cold until electroporation. Thaw the cells on an ice block and perform all steps quickly to ensure the highest possible efficiency. Assume the name of the plasmid DNA is P in this protocol and label tubes and plates using P as a prefix. You should replace P with the name of your plasmid.

You will need:

Plasmid DNA or Gibson assembly product (see table below depending on DNA source for transformation). 
One aliquot of electrocompetent cells. Label this tube P. These are usually stored in the -80C freezer. Allow cells to thaw for about 1 minute or until the cell mixture moves when the tube is “flicked”. You want a bacteria slushy here.
An ice cold electrocuvette, usually stored in the -20C freezer until needed.
1 mL of room temperature LB.
A 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube Pt.

* - See alternative protocol for setup instructions
** - When transforming many samples at one time from a high efficiency product like a miniprep, very little of a standard competent cell aliquot is needed. The aliquots from the freezer can be diluted 2x - 10x to save stocks.
Note: sometimes it is useful to plate 200 uL on one plate and the remainder on a second plate, either by spinning down the remainder, pouring off supernatant, and plating the remainder or by adding the remainder directly to liquid culture.


A. Transformation

Add 1-10 μL of DNA source (see table above) to the cells in the tube labeled P, swirl the tip gently in the culture to mix, and incubate on ice block for one minute.
Working quickly, transfer the contents of the aliquot into the center of the gap of an ice-cold electrocuvette from the freezer, and then place the electrocuvette in the electroporator. Check that the electroporator is set to deliver 1,250 V, and then press the PULSE button twice to deliver a pulse.
Again, working quickly, remove the electrocuvette from the electroporator and add 1 mL of room-temperature LB to it, pipetting up and down several times to extract the cells from the 1 mm gap.
Transfer entire contents of electrocuvette to the tube labeled Pt.
Check and record the discharge time constant (units are in milliseconds).
Incubate tube Pt at 37°C for 30-45 minutes. 

B. Wash cuvette

The cuvettes should be washed for reuse. If washed properly, they can be reused up to 10 times. For each cuvette, do the following while waiting for the cells to recover:
Squirt 95% ethanol to fill cuvette more than halfway. Add cap and invert cuvette a few times to disinfect it. Pour out in waste receptacle by sink.
Wash cuvette three times with DI H2O using squeeze bottle and dump water into sink. 
Squirt 95% ethanol in the cuvette, add the cap, and let it sit for an hour or overnight.
Pour out ethanol and place cuvette upside down on paper towel to dry.

C. Plating

You usually plate transformed cells on agar plates with selective media (e.g. Ampicillin) and possibly onto other plates with inducers (e.g. IPTG), etc. For each plate, do the following:

Transfer 100-300 μL of culture (see table above) to the appropriate plate using the large micropipettor. Do not place the plate lid on lab bench while you do this.
Add 5 to 10 sterile glass beads to the plate and swirl/shake the plate to spread the culture onto the agar. Dump the beads into the used bead beaker.
Replace plate top and incubate plate, upside-down, overnight at 37°C.
