##Protocol##

Day 1

1. Inoculate colonies from bacterial plate into either TB or LB containing antibiotics in 14ml glass culture tubes
2. Place in 37º shaker incubator


Day 2

1. Place 1ml of overnight culture in 1.5ml centrifuge tube
2. Spin cells at 6000g for 1 min and remove supernantent
3. Add 250µl of P1 buffer to pelleted cells in 1.5ml tubes, resuspend
4. Add 250µl of P2 buffer invert tubes 6-10 times, or until contents of tube turn blue
5. Add 350µl of N3 buffer invert tubes 6-10 times, or until contents of tube turn into white precipitate
6. Spin contents of 1.5 ml tubes at 17000g for 10 mins
7. Remove supernatant and place into miniprep spin columns, volume of supernatant ~900µl
8. Spin miniprep columns at 17000g for 1 min, discard flowthrough
9. Put 750µl of PE bufer into miniprep column and spin at 17000g for 1 min, discard flowthrough
10. Spin miniprep columns an additional time at 17000g to discard flowthrough
11. Place columns in fresh 1.5ml tubes and add 30~50µl of either EB or MGH2O, spin tube and column for 1 min at 17000g
12. Discard columns, keep 1.5 ml tubes label and nanodrop contents for DNA concentration
