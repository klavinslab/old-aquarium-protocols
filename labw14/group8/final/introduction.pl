  note: "You will combine several fragments with a larger plasmid (serving as a backbone). 
    You will then add Gibson master mix, which has x y z enzymes, which work in concert to 
    trim back, allow the fragments to join over overlapping regions (homologies), and then
    be stiched back together (add an image here from original paper). 
    This technique was discoverd in 20xx? and allows you to do in an hour what used to take
    x days.

  description: "The steps are as follows:"
  bullet: "Take the fragments and plasmid backbones"
  bullet: "Label and fill PCR tubes with water, then fragements"
  warning: "You must check that the thermocycler is available first, since exonuclease in master mix 
            begins eating fragments immediately"
  bullet: "Add the master mix, then put them in the thermocycler for X minutes 
  
  bullet: "Transform a bit of the resulting plasmid into E. Coli (to magnify it to make stock and test the transform successful)"
  bullet: "Plate the transformed cells overnight"
  bullet: "Image the plates to check the colony counts (measure of success) and retry failed Gibsons"
  bullet: "Calculate equimolar amounts to make a more likely succesful Gibson for failed ones"
  bullet: "Do another Gibson with the amounts you calculated. Transform and plate overnight"
  bullet: "For Gibsons that still didn't work, the person who wanted them done will try to troubleshoot what went wrong.
           Sometimes they don't work without any fault on your part, especially with more fragments."
