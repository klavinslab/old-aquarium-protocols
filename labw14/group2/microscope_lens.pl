  description: "Clean the lens"
  warning: "DO NOT USE A KIM WIPE FOR THIS STEP, YOU MAY DAMAGE THE LENS"
  bullet: "The lens is located within the center of the incubation chamber"
  bullet: "Using an Olympus lens cleaner located near the microscope clean the objective lens"
  note: "Rub gently in a circle on the lens to ensure proper cleaning"

  description: "Oil the lens"
  note: "The oil is located inside and on the right of the incubator."
  bullet: "Open the oil bottle intake some oil into the dropper"
  bullet: "Use the opening of the bottle to remove excess oil from the dropper"
  bullet: "Place one drop of oil directly in the center of the objective lens"
  bullet: "Recap the oil bottle and put it back inside the incubation chamber"

step
  description: "Cover plate in clear plastic wrap"
  bullet: "Remove the lid from our agar cell dish"
  bullet: "Tear an ample section of plastic wrap to cover the agar dish"
  bullet: "The film should be placed smoothly on the opening such that no wrinkles show"
  note: "There should be enough plastic wrap to completely cover the sides"
end

step
  description: "Attach the lens ring to the dish"
  bullet: "Carefully attach the lens ring to the bottom of our agar dish"
  bullet: "This should fit snuggly and hold the plastic wrap and dish firmly in place"
  bullet: "Indented side of the ring should be facing away from the opening of the dish"
  bullet: "Once in place tear away excess plastic wrap from the bottom of the dish."

step
  description: "Place dish on the lens stage"
  warning: "Becareful not to touch the dish to the objective lens, it may ruin the experiment"
  bullet: "Lower stage if necessary using the large knob on the right hand side of the microscope"
  bullet: "Adjust the screws to slide the dish ring side down into the stage on top of the objective lens"
  bullet: "Once placed adjust the screws on each side of the stage to center the dish and fimrly hold in place"
  note: "If the dish move finding cells may be impossible, and may also damage the lens."

step
  description: "Adjust the objective lens"
  warning: "THIS IS IMPORTANT IF THIS ISN'T DONE YOU MAY GET NO RESULTS"
  bullet: "Center the dish using the X-Y controller so the agar center is at the center of the lens focal point"
  bullet: "Locate the stage knob near the bottom right side of the eye piece"
  bullet: "This is the LARGER of the two knobs"
  bullet: "Adjust the objective lens toward the agar dish, just until the oil begins to spread on the bottom of the dish"
  note: "If the oil spreads too much this protocol must be restarted. If the oil doesn't spread at all you may not see any cells."
