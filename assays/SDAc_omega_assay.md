Day 7

Image plates and record CFUs
1. Remove plates from incubator and image using blue-light transilluminator.
2. Analyze CFU counts using openCFU software package on plate reader computer.
*Note: manually count colonies along plate edge that are not picked up by software and account for any false positives.*
3. Record each plate count in spreadsheet.
*Note: at 10^5 dilution, the number of colonies corresponds to 10^6 multiplier for CFU/mL.*
