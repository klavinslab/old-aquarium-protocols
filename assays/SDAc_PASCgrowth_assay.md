##Protocol##

Day 1

1. For each strain pick from glycerol stock into 200 uL of LB + kan + low amp in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube
2. Streak out 1 uL of each strain on LB + kan + low amp + IPTG plates, or aTc plates depending on desired initilization state
3. Place plates in 37 C incubator, dispose of 200 uL cultures


Day 2

1. Retrieve plates form 37 C incubator, or deli fridge if the first day was skipped and desired colonies are already avaliable
2. Pick one colony per streak into 200 uL of LB + kan + low amp in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube
3. Go to media bay and set up one large tube per colony with 6 mL of LB + kan + low amp, label sides
4. Inoculate tube with picked colonies by adding XXX uL of the 200 uL colony water into its respecitve LB tube
5. Place tubes in the 30 C shaker, dispose of 200 uL cultures
6. Parafilm plates and place in designated are in the deli fridge
7. 

Day 3

1. Set up cytometer plate by adding 50 uL of PBS to every even numbered column (or however many is enough to accomodate every strain)
2. Add 199 uL PBS to the odd numbered column (or however many is enough to accomodate every strain)
3. Add 1 uL of culture from the tall tubes to a well
4. Run cytometer plate using the template in the Paper Assays Folder
5. Ensure percent green is consistent with previously established results
