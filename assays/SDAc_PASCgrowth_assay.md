##Protocol##

Day 1

1. For each strain pick from glycerol stock into 200 uL of LB + kan + low amp in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube
2. Streak out 1 uL of each strain on LB + kan + low amp + IPTG plates, or aTc plates depending on desired initilization state
3. Place plates in 37 C incubator, dispose of 200 uL cultures


Day 2

1. Retrieve plates form 37 C incubator, or deli fridge if the first day was skipped and desired colonies are already avaliable
2. Pick one colony per streak into 200 uL of LB + kan + low amp in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.
3. Dilute each resuspended colony 10:1 into LB + kan + low amp (20 uL into 180 uL).
3. Go to media bay and set up one 20 mL glass tube per colony with 6 mL of LB + kan + low amp, label side of each tube.
4. Inoculate media with resuspended colony by adding 0.5 uL of the 10:1 diluted sample into its respecitve LB tube.
5. Place tubes in the 30 C shaker, dispose of 200 uL cultures
6. Parafilm plates and place in designated are in the deli fridge
7. 

Day 3

1. Set up cytometer plate by adding 50 uL of PBS to every even numbered column (or however many is enough to accomodate every strain)
2. Add 199 uL PBS to the odd numbered column (or however many is enough to accomodate every strain)
3. Add 1 uL of culture from the tall tubes to a well
4. Run cytometer plate using the template in the Paper Assays Folder
5. Ensure percent green is consistent with previously established results
6. Inoculate 30 uL of the LB overnight into a 3 mL M9 0.4% PASC culture (with 200:1 kan and 500:1 amp) in a 14 mL glass tube.
7. Moderately vortex culture (avoid splashing) for 10 seconds and sample 100 uL for initial CFU count.
8. Place PASC culture in 37 C incubator.
9. Plate a 10^5 [serial dilution](https://github.com/klavinslab/protocols/blob/master/assays/assay_quality_CFU_plating_best_practices.md) of the starting culture and incubate at 37 C for 16-20 hours to obtain an initial CFU measurement.
