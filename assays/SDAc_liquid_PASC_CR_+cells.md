##Protocol##

Congo Red Absorbance with Cells

1. Transfer 1 mL of LB grown DL146 cells to a 1.5 mL tube and pellet cells.
2. Pipette off supernatant and resuspend cells in 1 mL M9 no carbon.
3. Add 100 uL of 0.4% PASC to 8 1.5 mL tubes.
4. Dilute 20 uL of washed culture into 180 uL PBS until a 10^-6 dilution.
5. For each dilution (including undiluted culture), add 100 uL of culture to the 100 uL of PASC.
6. Add 100 uL plain PBS to the eighth PASC tube.
7. Add 200 uL of 0.3% Congo Red and incubate for 30 minutes.
8. Measure absorbance on spectrophotometer.

Washed PASC

1. Add 100 uL of %0.4 PASC to 5 1.5 mL tubes.
2. Add 100 uL of undiluted culture to 4 of the tubes and plain PBS to the 5th.
3. Genlty centrifuge the tubes to pellet the PASC, but leave cells suspended.
4. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the PASC pellet with 100 uL of PBS.
5. Set aside the PBS control and one of the tubes with cells.
6. Repeat the process with the three remaining samples.
7. Continue until there is one tube that has been washed once, one twice, one three times, and one four times.
8. Add 100 uL of 0.3% Congo Red and incubate for 30 minutes.
9. Measure absorbance on spectrophotometer.
