Description:
This protocol describes how, through much trial and tribulation, the SDAc team has refined the 
CFU plating process to produce as small of error bars as possible.

##Protocol##

1. Determine (estimate) the lowest dilution factor needed for your sample(s) that will 
ideally give between 10 and 150 colonies on the incubated plate (E.G. saturated LB: 10^-7).
2. Label the appropriate agar plates with sample name and dilution factor.
3. Add 5 to 8 sterile beads to each plate and then flip lid side down.
4. Skipping the first row of a sterile 96 well plate, fill each well with 180 uL of PBS
until the row corresponding to the lowest dilution (row 2 -> 10^-1 ... row 8 -> 10^-7)
and the column corresponding to the last sample (col 1 -> sample 1 ... col 12 -> sample
12).
5. Vortex liquid culture samples.
6. For each sample, transfer 100 uL well mixed culture into the top row of the 96 well
plate.
7. With a P20 multichannel pipette set to 20 uL, mix the undiluted culture in the top
row by pipetting up and down 5 to 10 times. 
8. Fully eject the content of the tips, and then pipette 20 uL from the undiluted
culture into the second row (10^-1).
9. Discard the tips after the first transfer.
10. With new tips, use the P20 multichannel to mix the 10^-1 dilution by pipetting up 
and down 10 times.
11. Fully eject the content of the tips, and then pipette 20 uL from the 10^-1
dilution (row 2) into the 10^-2 dilution (row 3).
12. Without changing tips, repeat steps 8 and 9 until the row with the lowest desired 
dilution is reached.
13. Order the labelled plates in correspondence with the order of the samples in each
column.
14. For 4 to 6 plates in a row, transfer EXACTLY 100 uL of the lowest dilution to the 
center of the agar of each plate. Be sure to mix the well contents first by pipetting
up and down a few times.
15. Once each of the 4 to 6 plates has 100 uL of cells, gently shake the beads across
the plate to evenly spread the liquid until it is dry.
16. Flip the plates lid side down and repeat steps 14 and 15 until all samples are 
complete.
17. Dispose the beads into a dirty bead receptacle.
18. Incubate the plates at 37 degrees C until the colonies are 2 to 3 mm in diameter
(12-16 hours).
