** Note: before starting assay, please book cytometer time in advance for all reads. Reading samples at specific times is critical to running a successful assay. **

##Assay##

Day 1 (by 3 pm)

1. Plug in electric Bunsen burner.
2. Label 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes with the following labels
    * DL046 (T12/A10 SDAc)
    * DL107 (T12/A12 SDAc)
    * DL108 (T18/A10 SDAc)
    * DL110 (T16/A10 SDAc)
    * DL112 (T14/A10 SDAc)
    * DL146 (T14/A10 SDAc)
    * DL147 (T12/A10 fullTrunc)
    * DL180 (pCellulose)
    * DL182 (T16/A10 fullTrunc)
    * DL183 (T14/A10 fullTrunc)
    * DL188 (T18/A10 fullTrunc)
3. Fill each tube with 100 uL LB + 200:1 kan + 500:1 amp.
4. Topically add 20 uL aTc (diluted into 100 uL H2O) to LB + 200:1 kan + 500:1 amp plates. Shake with beads to spread solution.
5. At -80 C freezer, transfer glycerol stock stab for each strain from (2) to labeled 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.
5. After trisecting each plate, streak plates from glycerol stock suspensions.
6. Unplug electric Bunsen burner.
7. Incubate in 37 C incubator for 12 to 16 hours.

Day 2 Morning (9 am)

1. Prepare 33 14 mL glass tubes with 2 mL LB + Kan (200:1) + Amp (500:1) + IPTG (1000:1).
2. Prepare 15 14 mL glass tubes with 2 mL LB + Kan (200:1) + Amp (500:1) + aTc (1000:1).
3. Pick 3 colonies from each restreak of DL046, DL107, DL108, DL110, DL112, DL146, DL147, DL180, DL182, DL183, and DL188. Transfer to LB + IPTG tube.
4. Pick 3 colonies from each restreak of DL146, DL147, DL182, DL183, and DL188. Transfer to LB + aTc tube.
5. Incubate in 37 C shaker until turbid, or 12 hours.

Day 2 Evening (9 pm)
*Note: do the centrifuge step in sets of 12 tubes to minimize pellet loss.*
1. Mix and transfer 500 uL of each turbid LB culture to a labeled Eppendorf tube.
2. Centrifuge at 5,000 xg for 2 minutes to pellet cells.
3. Pipette off supernatant, taking care to not disturb cell pellet.
4. Add 1 mL M9 no carbon and pipette vigorously to resuspend pellet. Take care to not contaminate pipette body.
5. Transfer 1 uL resuspended culture to 1 mL M9 0.4% cellobiose culture volume and incubate at 37 C.
**Prepare to sample cell state in 12 hours.**
6. In a yellow Phenix 96-well plate, add 200 uL PBS to all odd columns using a multichannel pipettor.
7. Add 50 uL PBS to all even columns.
8. Transfer 2 uL of each resuspended well to appropriate well in table below for cytometer sampling.

Day 3 Morning (9 am)

**12 hour measurement**
1. Prepare Phenix cytometer plate with 50 uL PBS in even columns 6 through 12.
2. Remove plate from shaker/incubator.
3. Using multichannel pipette, mix deep well plate, column by column, with pipettor set to 80 uL by pipetting up and down several (5 to 8) times.
*Note: take care to not cross-contaminate wells!*
4. Transfer 80 uL directly from each growth well to the appropriate odd column wells - 2(x-1)+1 where x is the column number from the culture plate.
5. Transfer plate to cytometer and run autosampler template for switching rate assay (full plate read).
6. Determine dilution volume for each sample (see Dilution Protocol below).
