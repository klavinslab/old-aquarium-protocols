##Protocol##

Day 1

MEDIA BENCH
1. Prepare 40 mL of 0.4% Glucose M9 Media with 200 uL of Kanamycin (1:200) and 80 uL of Ampicillin (1:500) in a 50 mL conical
2. Label 12 14 mL glass culture tubes with DL046, DL108, and DL147 Reps 1-4
3. Use the electric pipette with a 5 mL tip to alliquot 3 mL of media into each tube

CULTURE BENCH
4. Pick 4 colonies of each DL1046, DL108, and DL147 from the streak out plate into the appropriately labelled tube
5. Place the tubes in the 37C shaker incubator overnight

Day 2 & 3

1. Prepare 15 mL of 0.4% Glucose M9 Media with 75 uL of Kanamycin (1:200) and 30 uL of Ampicillin (1:500) in a 50 mL conical
2. Prepare 1 mL of 200 ng/mL aTc using a concentrated stock and molecular grade water
3. Retrieve cultures from the shaker
4. Line rows A and H and columns 1 and 12 with 200 uL of DI H20
5. Fill the rest of the wells with 200 uL of the prepared glucose media
6. Inoculate each well with 10 uL (1:20) of the appropriate culture (see table)
7. Wipe down the inside of a 96 well plate lid with de-fogger solution
8. Roll a small piece of foil to place on the corner of the plate to keep the lid from shaking
9. Induce the 0 HR wells with 1 uL of aTc (see table)
10. Put the lid on the plate with the foil
11. Place plate in the plate reader and start software
12. At 1, 1.5, 2, and 24 hrs, pause the software and induce the appropriate wells with 1 uL aTc (see table)
13. Return the plate and restart the program
14. Run for 36 hrs total
15. Export and analyze data if desired
