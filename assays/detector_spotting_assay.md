#Protocol#

Day 1
------
1. Add 1mL of LB + 1:500 Amp to each culture tube OR to each well needed for a variant (1 well per variant) in the 96 deep-well plate
2. Label each tube with variant name, or record which variant is in each deepwell.
3. Add a stab of each variant (colony) to the appropriate culture tube or well.
4. Place all culture tubes or the deepwell plate in the 42C shaker overnight.

Day 2
------
1. Label all the 9 amplicillin plates on the bottom with the variant name, date and the following: 

* Chlor- aTc- 
* Chlor- 100 ng/mL aTc
* Chlor- 1ng/mL aTc 
* 17 ug/mL Chlor aTc- 
* 17 ug/mL Chlor 100 ng/mL aTc
* 17 ug/mL Chlor 1 ng/mL aTc
* 6.8 ng/mL Chlor aTc-
* 6.8 ng/mL Chlor 100ng/mL aTc
* 6.8 ng/mL Chlor 10ng/mL aTc.

2. On the bottom of each plate, draw an identical grid corresponding to the number of variants; if the variants are in a deepwell plate, have the grid correspond to the location of each variant in the plate. Record what variant each grid location corresponds to.
3. Add 200uL of MGH20 to each of 9 1.5mL Eppendorf tube and label similarly to the ampicillin plates
4. To all tubes from number 3 labelled with "100ng/mL aTc" add 20uL of aTc.
5. Label and empty Eppendorf tube "10ug/mL aTc." Add 10uL of aTc to 90uL of MGH20 in this tube. Mix by vortexing and table-top centrifugation for a few seconds.
6. To all of the tubes from number 3 labelled with "1ng/mL aTc" add 2uL of the 10ug/mL aTc from step 5.
7. To all of the tubes from number 3 labelled with "1:2000 chlor" add 10uL of dChlor.
8. To all of the tubes from number 3 labelled with "1:5000 chlor" add 4uL of dChlor.
9. Mix all 9 Eppendorf tubes from number 3 now with their added chemicals by vortexing and table-top centrifugation for a few seconds.
10. Add all off the contents of the tubes from number 9 to the ampicillin plate with the same name.
11. Add 5-8 media-spreading beads to each ampicillin plate and shake the plates to spread the added media.
12. Once the media is spread, discard the beads in the bead disposal and let the plates sit with their lids on for 20 minutes.
13. Remove the overnights of the variants from Day 1 from the 42C incubator. 
14. Using the multichannel pipette, suck up 20uL of each variant in one row of the grid, and spot ~2uL into the appropriate spot on each plate.
15. Once all variants have been spotted, let each plate dry for 10 minutes, or until spots dry.
16. Place each plate, upside-down, in 30C incubator overnight.

Day 3
------
1. Remove plates from incubator.
2. Image each plate using the camera and dark reader.
