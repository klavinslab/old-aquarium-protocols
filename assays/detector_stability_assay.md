[Detector Stability Assay]
--------------
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Description: This assay tests whether detector strains are stable in both the ON and OFF state. Both states should be stable i.e if induced into either state and then grown in absence of inducer, strains should maintain that state. This assay will likely follow detector_screening_assay, which tests whether strains can be induced into distinct ON and OFF states.

##Protocol##

Day 1

1. Remove each LB Amp agar plate from the fridge and place in 30C. Wait until room temperature. Proceed to step 2 while waiting.
2. Turn on bunsen burner to allow it to heat.
3. Label each stripwell tube with strain name or glycerol stock number.
4. Add 30uL of LB Amp to each stripwell tube.
5. Resuspend small stab of each strain into appropriate stripwell from glycerol stock, plate, etc. Mix well by pipetting up and down.
6. Once the plates are warm, remove from incubator so as to label. If necessary, properly bisect or trisect each plate by drawing lines on the plasitc back with a Sharpie. Label each section of the plate with the strain name or glycerol stock number. Date the plate.
7. Add 1uL of first strain from appropriate stripwell onto appropriate section of plate, as per the plating protocol. Using the bunsen burner and sterile loop, plate the strain using the plating protocol method.
8. Repeat step 7 for each strain.
9. Place all plate, bottoms-up, in the 30C incubator. Leave overnight.

Day 2

1. Remove plates from Day 1 from incubator. Confirm there are at least 3 colonies that can be picked for each strain.
2. Add 1mL of LB 1:500 Amp to each culture tube (if there is less than 3 colonies than can be picked for a strain, only prepare as many culture tubes as are colonies). Label each tube.
3. Add a stab of appropriate colony from each strain to appropraite tube. There will be colony 1, colony 2, and colony 3 for each strain, and a separate tube for each replicate.
4. Move all of the tubes (with caps on) to 42C incubator. Leave overnight. 

Day 3

1. 
2. Add 1mL of LB 1:500 Amp to each culture tube (if there is less than 3 colonies than can be picked for a strain, only prepare as many culture tubes as are colonies). Label each tube.
3. Add a stab of appropriate colony from each strain to appropraite tube. There will be colony 1, colony 2, and colony 3 for each strain, and a separate tube for each replicate.
4. Move all of the tubes (with caps on) to 42C incubator. Leave overnight.
