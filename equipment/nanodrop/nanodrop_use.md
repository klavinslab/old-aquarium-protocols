Nanodrop
 
 
Nucleic Acids
 
Determine the concentration of DNA (ng/μL) in a sample
 
1.  Open nanodrop program and select 'Nucleic Acids'
 
2.  Clean the nanodrop with a kimwipe - bottom and top
 
3.  Pipet 1.5 μL of molecular grade water onto the nanodrop to initialize it - make sure the water forms into a column
 
4.  Blank:
        - if your blank is water, click 'blank'
        - if your blank is a buffer, clean water off with a kimwipe and pipet 1.5 μL of blank onto nanodrop and click 'blank'
 
5.  Clean with a kimwipe
 
6.  Pipet 1.5 μL of sample onto nanodrop, click 'measure'
        - write concentration (ng/μL) and the date on the side of the sample tube
 
7.  Clean with a kimwipe
 
8.  Continue with other sample by repeating steps 6 and 7
 
9.  Clean with a kimwipe when your done
 
 
Cell Cultures
 
Determine the concentration of a cell culture
 
1.  Open nanodrop program and select 'Cell Cultures'
 
2.  Initialize with 1.5 μL of water, clean with a kimwipe
 
3.  Blank with 1.5 μL of broth, clean with a kimwipe
 
4.  Pipet 2 μL of cell culture onto nanodrop and click 'measure'
        - Read at 600 nm absorbance
 
5.  Clean nanodrop with bleach when finished
