##Protocol##

Day 1

1. This is an electroporator. An electroporator is a device that gets plasmid DNA into E.coli 
cells through a process called electroporation.
2. Take a tube of competent cells from the freezer.
3. This is a tube of competent cells, place it on ice. We have already prepared special cells called
competent cells that have been washed to remove any extra ions which helps this process along. It
is important to put the cells on ice when they're out of the freezer or else they will lose their
competentcy and the DNA will not transform.
4. Take electrocurvette.
5. This is an electrocurvette. This is what the cells mixture will be put into which allows the 
electroporator to apply the voltage.
6. Take DNA.
7. This is the plasmid DNA that will be transformed. Plasmid DNA is a circular piece of DNA that encodes
several genes. Plasmid DNA can be broken down into two main portions: the vector backbone and the insert.
The backbone encodes the origin of replication and the antibiotic resistance. The origin of replication
signals cellular machinery to copy the plasmid when the cell divides. The antibiotc resistance confers
resistance to a certain antibiotic which helps us select for the cell that have the plasmid.
8. Take molecular grade water.
9. Dilute the DNA to 100 pg/ul. Find the concentration of the DNA on the side of the tube and figure out
how much water to mix with how much DNA.
