##Protocol##

Day 1

1. This is an electroporator. An electroporator is a device that gets plasmid DNA into E.coli 
cells through a process called electroporation.
2. Take a tube of competent cells from the freezer.
3. This is a tube of competent cells, place it on ice. We have already prepared special cells called
competent cells that have been washed to remove any extra ions which helps this process along. It
is important to put the cells on ice when they're out of the freezer or else they will lose their
competentcy and the DNA will not transform.
4. Take electrocurvette.
5. This is an electrocurvette. This is what the cells mixture will be put into which allows the 
electroporator to apply the voltage.
6. Take DNA.
7. This is the plasmid DNA that will be transformed. Plasmid DNA is a circular piece of DNA that encodes
several genes. Plasmid DNA can be broken down into two main portions: the vector backbone and the insert.
The backbone encodes the origin of replication and the antibiotic resistance. The origin of replication
signals cellular machinery to copy the plasmid when the cell divides. The antibiotc resistance confers
resistance to a certain antibiotic which helps us select for the cell that have the plasmid.
8. Take molecular grade water.
9. Dilute the DNA to 100 pg/ul. Find the concentration of the DNA on the side of the tube and figure out
how much water to mix with how much DNA. Use the pipetting skills you learned in the earlier tutorials
to figure out which volumes are appropriate.
10. Add DNA to cell aliquots. By now, the cell aliqots should have thawed out. Remove the cell tube from
the ice block and make sure that the contents are a slush and not a solid. Pipet the DNA into the cell aliqot
and mix up and down.
11. Let the cell DNA mixture to sit on ice. Do this for a minute. In the mean time, I want to warn you that
you have to do the next few steps very quickly, so you might want to read through the next page completely before
you even start to do anything.
