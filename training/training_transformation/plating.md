##Protocol##

Day 1

1. Label the appropriate agar plates with sample name and other relevant information 
(such as date, dilution factor etc.).
2. Add 5 to 8 sterile beads to each plate and then flip lid side down.
3. For up to 6 plates in a row, transfer EXACTLY 100 uL of the appropriate liquid culture to the 
center of the agar of each plate. Be sure to mix the well contents first by pipetting
up and down a few times.
4. Once each of the 4 to 6 plates has 100 uL of cells, gently shake the beads across
the plate, rotating occasionally, to evenly spread the liquid until it is dry.
5. Flip the plates lid side down and repeat steps 3. and 4. until all samples are 
complete.
17. Dispose the beads into a dirty bead receptacle. Be careful not to leave the lid off for too
long, or to let the plate face agar side up.
18. Incubate the plates at 37 degrees C until the colonies are 1 to 3 mm in diameter
(16-24 hours).

Day 2

1. Once the colonies have reached the desired size, remove the plates from the incubator.
2. Perform appropriate processing (e.g. parafilm wrapping and refrigerating, colony picking etc.).

####Common Issues####

    Colonies are mainly around the edge of plate:
        - Beads are likely swirling around the edge of the plate. Be sure to shake the beads directly 
        across the plate with consistent rotation.
    Colonies are large, splotchy, and close together:
        - Plates are likely too wet with condensation. Prewarm plates in the 30 degree incubator for
        at least 30 minutes prior to plating.
