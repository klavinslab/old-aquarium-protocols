Description:

This protocol teaches the fundementals of pipetting though a large and a small 
volume pipetting exercise and then demonstrates how to calculate the error
associated with pipetting.

##Protocol##

Preparation:

1. Fill each test tube about 2/3 full with sink water.
2. To each test tube add one drop of a different color of food coloring.
(Make sure the blue and purple drops are very small because the color is dark).
3. Label each tube as I, II, III, and IV.
4. Put test tubes in a test tube rack and set aside.

Large Volume Exercise:

1. Take out six 1.5 mL tubes out of the box and label them A - E. Put tubes
C - D off to the side.
2. Using the 1 mL pipette, add solution I to the tubes: 100 μL to A and 150 μL
to B.
3. Using the same pipette but a fresh tip, add solution II to the tubes: 200 
μL to A and 250 μL to B.
4. Using the same pipette but a fresh tip, add solution III to the tubes: 150 
μL to A and 350 μL to B.
5. Using the same pipette but a fresh tip, and solution IV to the tubes: 550 μL
to A and 250 μL to B.
6. Each tube should now have 1 mL in it, so to check the error from pipetting,
set the 1 mL pipettor to 1000 μL and draw up as much liquid as possible from each 
tube. If there is still liquid left in the tube, too much was added. If there is air 
at the end of the tube, too little was added. If too little was added, to determine 
the error,slowly decrease the volume until the liquid reaches the end of the tube. 
the error rate is (100 - final volume).
7. Throw out tubes A and B.
