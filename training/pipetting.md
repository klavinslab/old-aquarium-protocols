This protocol teaches the fundementals of pipetting though a large and a small 
volume pipetting exercise and then demonstrates how to calculate the error
associated with pipetting.

##Protocol##

Preparation:

1. Fill each test tube about 2/3 full with sink water.
2. To each test tube add one drop of a different color of food coloring.
(Make sure the blue and purple drops are very small because the color is dark).
3. Label each tube as I, II, III, and IV.
4. Put test tubes in a test tube rack and set aside.

Large Volume Exercise:

1. Take out six 1.5 mL tubes out of the box and label them A - E. Put tubes
C - D off to the side.
2. Using the 1 mL pipette, add solution I to the tubes: 100 μL to A and 150 μL
to B.
3. Using the same pipette but a fresh tip, add solution II to the tubes: 200 
μL to A and 250 μL to B.
4. Using the same pipette but a fresh tip, add solution III to the tubes: 150 
μL to A and 350 μL to B.
5. Using the same pipette but a fresh tip, and solution IV to the tubes: 550 μL
to A and 250 μL to B.
6. Each tube should now have 1 mL (total volume) in it, so to check the error 
from pipetting,set the 1 mL pipette to 1000 μL and draw up as much liquid as 
possible from each tube. 
7. Calculate measurement error.
8. Throw out tubes A and B

Small Volume Exercise:
1. Take out tubes C - E, and the 10 μL pipette and pipette tip box.
2. Add solution I to the tubes: 4 μL in in C, 4 μL in D, and 4 μL in E.
3. Using the same pipette but a new tip, add solution II to the tubes: 5 μL
to C, 5 μL to D, and 4 μL to E.
4. Using the same pipette but a new tip, add solution III to the tuebs: 1 μL
to C, and 1 μL to E.
5. Using the same pipette but a new tip, add solution IV to the tubes: 1 μL
to D and 1 μL to E.
6. Each tube should now have 10 μL (total volume) in it, so to check the error from 
pipetting, set the 10 μL pipette to 10 μL and draw up as much liquid as possible
from each tube. 
7. Calculate measurement error.
8. Throw out tubes C - E.

Calculate Measurement Error:

IF there is still liquid left in the tube, too much was added. To determine
the error if too much was added, discard the tip with liquid in it and get a fresh
tip. Carefully pipette up the remaining liquid in the tip, and then rotate the 
volume dial until the liquid reaches the bottom of the tip. The error rate is 
new volume / total volume.

OR IF there is air at the end of the tip, too little was added. If too little was added, 
to determine the error, slowly decrease the volume until the liquid reaches the end 
of the tip. The error rate is (total volume - new volume)/ total volume. 

OR if the tube is filled exactly with liquid, the measurement error is 0.
