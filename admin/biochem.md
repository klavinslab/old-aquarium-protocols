####Common Issues####

    Finding the biochem store:
        - It is easiest to enter the J-wing through the side door of Health 
          Sciences that's across from Hitchcock and then go down one floor
          
    Does the biochem store carry this item?
        - The biochem store has a list of all their inventory available
          on their website
